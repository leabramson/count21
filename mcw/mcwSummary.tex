\noindent {\bf Summary:} Volunteers surveying Hollywood and East Hollywood on February 25, 
2021, found $12\%$ fewer adults experiencing unsheltered homelessness compared to the 2020 
LAHSA Count. A 30\% drop in the number of individuals---as opposed to dwellings---seen on the street
drives this change (Figure \ref{fig:rawCounts}) even as tents doubled in over $1/4$ of 
census tracts. This phenomenon could support subjective impressions that the state of homelessness 
has worsened despite a drop in raw numbers. Given COVID-related contractions in
health, sanitation, and social services, such perceptions may in fact be accurate. Data from the 
Coordinated Entry System will reveal if homelessness has declined generally, or if government 
initiatives have reduced only Greater Hollywood's share of it.

%Combined with COVID-related contractions in health, sanitation, and social 
%services, this increase in the salience of unsheltered living would support impressions that the crisis
%worsened over the past year despite fewer people being on the street. 

% contribute to an accurate such perceptions may in fact be accurate.
%This enhanced visual salience---combined with COVID-related 
%sanitation and social service disruptions---would support perceptions that conditions worsened 
%over the past year despite the potential success of initiatives to bring and keep Angelenos indoors.

census tracts in Hollywood and East Hollywood on February 25, 2021 (Figure \ref{fig:tcomp}).\\

%Nine tracts were counted by professional outreach teams during the %---comprising $\sim$43\% of identified individuals and dwellings---
%day. The remainder were surveyed by car-based volunteer teams starting at 7:00 PM.

%Each team surveyed two tracts. To increase accuracy, each tract was surveyed by at

%Tracts counted by professionals were assessed only once. No 
%volunteers and only one professional team counted tracts in both communities, making the two datasets

%Year-on-year trends hold across communities and between volunteer- and professional-counted tracts.

\noindent {\bf Results:} The population estimates in Table \ref{tbl:summary} %and Figure \ref{fig:wtComp} 
reflect all people, cars, vans, RVs, tents, and makeshift dwellings seen that night with each
dwelling weighted by its average occupancy. We use the same %quoted in Table \ref{tbl:summary} and shown in teal in Figure \ref{fig:wtComp}
\href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4635-usc-2018-2020-multipliers-and-estimates-overview}
{SPA4/CD13 weights} as the last official 
\href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4686-2020-greater-los-angeles-city-community-homelessness-report-service-planning-area-4.pdf}
{LAHSA Community Summaries}. 
%These suggest $\nh$ and $\ne$ people were experiencing unsheltered 
%homelessness, \resp, on 25 Feb.\ (90\% CI). 
Using weights based on a February tent survey or the last 
\href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4693-2020-greater-los-angeles-homeless-count-cvrtm-conversion-factors}{SPA4-wide} values has no significant effect.
%\footnote{Those inferences yield $912\pm68$ and $944\pm118$ people
%in Hollywood, and $539\pm59$ and $559\pm87$ in E.~Hollywood, \resp.}  % (Figure \ref{fig:wtComp})
All suggest at least an 89\% chance of a decline compared to 2020. 

To erase the decline we infer, tents would have to shelter $\sim$45\% more people on average now 
compared to last year. At least since 2018, such a large change has never been seen. The aforementioned tent survey showed that tent occupancies are similar to 2020, making such a shift even more unlikely.\footnote{\selah\ 
outreach teams surveyed 47 tents in Hollywood on 28 Feb., finding an average of $1.50\pm0.22$ 
people per tent vs.~LAHSA's 2020 value of $1.48\pm0.11$.}
%however. If the average tent, e.g., holds more people today 
%compared to last year, then part of the inferred population decrease may be an artifact.
%\footnote{The $T$ and $M$ weights are the largest 
%potential errors in this analysis due to the high proportion of people living in tents and makeshift structures. 
%The full 2021 PIT area has not been assessed, but \selah\ outreach teams surveyed 47 tents (38 responses) in 
%Hollywood on 28 Feb., finding a mean occupancy of $T=1.39\pm0.14$ people per tent ($T=1.50\pm0.22$ if 
%non-responses are modeled). $M$ was not estimated, but that $T$ value is consistent with the LAHSA 2020 
%weight of $T=1.48\pm0.11$. We encourage larger efforts to update the CVRTM weights.} 
%the occupancy increases needed to erase our estimated changes are
%substantial. 

Other data suggest that our 2021 enumeration is accurate: (1) 38 duplicate tract measurements 
show that counting errors are consistent with random mistakes, which the analysis accounts for; (2) 
\href{https://hollywoodpartnership.com/}{\it The Hollywood Partnership} found the same result for
a common tract on 19 Feb.; (3) trends in Hollywood and East Hollywood agree despite being counted 
by different teams; (4) a \href{https://selahnch.org}{\selah} recount of a tract in East Hollywood two 
days later agrees with our data. Finally, if cars and vans in safe parking spots were missed, the chance 
of a decline from 2020 is still 89\%.\\

% 1907.00 is also interesting in that total population stayed nearly the same but identified
% individuals and dwellings basically swapped: IND 73->38; CVRTM 31->70. This has a big impact
% on people's perceptions, and it's in a very high-traffic part of the community.

%The pro/vol trends are consistent everywhere except tract 1927.00, 
%			where pro counts dropped significantly more for both individuals and dwellings (esp.\ 
%			tents). 1927.00 comprises 22\% of total counts in East Hollywood. Unsheltered 
%			homelessness in that CoC was flat or rose slightly outside of that tract.}
%{\bfr 1927.00 is the tract with the PATH Madison PSH. Phase II opened in Jan 2020---leasing began May 
%2020---and is 120 units, some of which were filled from nearby folks but I dunno how many. LEA recounted 
%this tract 4 March at $\sim$9:00 AM and found 94 total population vs.\ pro's 129. Only place where
%LEA counted more objects was vans. Adding that to the pro total adds 16 people (9 vans).

% All of the above suggests that our results are reliable.\\
%Assumes equal mix of cars + vans.
%From Starkey: Hwood = 25, Eho = 10, EchoPk = 14; total = 49; total CD13 = 59 but I think it's reasonable
%to truncate at Echo Pk. It's 90% if you include all 59 spaces.

\noindent {\bf Comments:} The change we find mainly reflects a $\sim$30\% drop in the raw number
of adult individuals seen on the street. This fact has caused the total number of unsheltered people to shrink 
even as tents more than doubled in 28\% of tracts. Government initiatives to stop evictions and move 
people indoors and may be responsible. If \href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4672-2020-homeless-count-council-district-13}{CD13's} 6.5\% share of \href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4585-2020-greater-los-angeles-homeless-count-los-angeles-continuum-of-care-coc-}{LA County's unsheltered seniors} 
is an indication, 100 Greater Hollywood residents might have been in any of Project Roomkey's 
\href{https://projectroomkeytracker.com/}{1608 active rooms} on the night of the count---about half the 
inferred change. The new Riverside \href{https://www.lamayor.org/ABridgeHome}
{\it A Bridge Home} and 120 PATH supportive housing units may also have contributed.
%The latter are located in tract 1927.00. While all of those units did not go to local residents, any that did would help
%drive that tract's large observed decrease. 
Coordinated Entry System data will show if the above scenarios are true.
%1927.00 is actually in the catchment of 3 ABHs that were either new or expanded between PIT counts. 
%Lodi, however, did not fill its new beds, and Lafayette doesn't cover the whole tract, so we won't speculate.
%Nevertheless, technically, even at 50\% decompression, residents of 1927.00 may have been eligible 
%for any of 89 new ABH beds. It's also on the CoC boundary.

If there are fewer people on the street, however, their quality of life is worse. 
COVID has restricted or eliminated access to restaurant bathrooms, libraries 
(\href{https://www.lapl.org/homeless-resources/the-source}{\it The Source}), DPSS 
(EBT, Medi-Cal), DMV (IDs), and DMH facilities. Physical limits on client access at 
hospitals has also kept caseworkers from managing successful discharges. These harms 
are reflected by a 25\% increase in 
\href{https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-07/the-powerful-synthetic-opioid-fentanyl-is-behind-rising-deaths-in-the-homeless-population}{overdose deaths} and made more visible by \href{https://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2020/20-0147_misc_3-17-20_p.pdf}{suspended}
tent folding and sanitation practices as tents increased in many places. 
Of course, a decline of just 12\% means substantial coming challenges
 \href{https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-12/new-report-foresees-tens-of-thousands-losing-homes-by-2023}
{as eviction moratoriums lapse}.

If our data support the effectiveness of programs aimed at reducing street homelessness, 
they do {\it not} suggest that the state of homelessness has improved. In the fight to rebuild lives---as well 
as build homes---that fact must remain paramount.

%
% {\bfr Five ABH's cover Greater Hollywood,
%three have catchment areas covering 1927.00. Their net addition is 33 beds, total, but 89 in that tract (whose
%net gain is eroded by losses of preexisting beds from Schrader and Garnder in the west).}

%DPSS closed; phone system with long waits req'd to replace EBT. If you don't have a phone your stuck.

%Libraries are closed, and therefore {\it The Source} service connection events. 
%Daytime charity resources and some parks are closed, resulting in more exposure to the weather and less food.

%Med-Cal not accessible via DPSS. Enrolling in health insurance requires similar phone calls and that a state 
%ID be uploaded (previously not required). Lacking insurance affects likelihood and length of admission to hospital. 
%Discharges requiring skilled or recuperative care placements are even more difficult.

%DMV is by appointment only and appointments are made online.

%DMH clinic services done via telehealth, leaving homeless clients hanging. One FSP has abandoned all field work due to COVID. 
%Clients in crisis needing evaluations redirected to hospitals.

%Hospitals, IMD's step down facilities and SNF's do not allow visitors, limiting the ability of case managers to negotiate 
%with clients and social workers to ensure successful discharges. Consent forms for sharing info cannot be signed by patients 
%due to lack of access.
%
%Homeless people have gotten sicker while hospitals and LAFD have become overburdened dealing with COVID fallout, 
%resulting in less access to emergency care.

%{\bfr KANAGI: ``we've seen a visual drop; dunno where they went but...'' On 2/18 they found 136 
%total tents in the BID vs our 127 (I haven't vetted the rest of the lines; that's just 12\# hot so w/e). (Also 99
%ppl compared to our 89, and 7 vehicles to our 10 and we weren't tracking those as hard as tents.) 
%On the 5th, they counted 163. That's a 17\% decline in 2 weeks, a little more that what we've seen year on year.
%Suggests maybe something happened in early Feb.? -- 3/2 @ 9:55 AM. The tent+mkshft count in 1902.02 is also 
%right on..}

%Only seven tracts saw significant increases in raw counts, with makeshift dwellings the only category to increase in both CoCs. 

%Cars and vans are hard to count, but there's no evidence of a bias. I repeated the most deviant tract the next day, 
%and another tract the day after that. In the latter case, both of my estimates were 0.5 units off the mean, in the 
%former, vans were at that level and I counted fewer cars. Brian and I also recovered a consistent amount of vehicles 
%with the BID (10 vs. their 6 separated by 20+ days). The rest of the tracts show a mean inter-counter bias of 0.6 
%cars (0.4 std.~err) and 1.24 ($0.76\sigma$) vans across all tracts, which should be accounted for in the MC.

% Pro teams counted areas comprising $\sim$43\% of the total raw counts. Three out of these 4 tracts 
% were counted by Covenant House teams, but 1927.00 has the largest drop of any tract and is Elyse 
% from The Center. That tract is basically responsible for the entire decline in East Hollywood, and most 
% of that is in reduced tents, so we should 	talk to these teams.
