For analyzing count results:

1. Master program is "countAll.pro". This will turn the count CSV into a fits file,
   then take the count fits file, average over duplicates, and monte carlo. The countAll
   subroutine will produce a results fits file, which will have raw counts and population
   inferences (all monte carlo trials included) for each tract (1 line per tract).

   countAll can take various CVRTM input weights and weight errors, allowing the effects
   of changing those to be characterized.

   a. The generalized version of countAll is "countRegion.pro", which lacks some hardcoded
      items specific to Hollywood (e.g., the flag for ID-ing tracts in East Hollywood).

2. The count file can be sent to "charDupes.pro" to characterize inter-conter variance
   at the tract-integrated and category levels. This will produce a couple of plots to
   illustrate how multiply counted tract results compare to Poisson expectations.

3. "makePlots.pro", "dumpPremade.pro", and "dumpText.pro" all generate ancillary files for
   each tract or region. The first generates the output population PDFs, the latter
   generate text files for the categories in raw counts, population, and population share
   which can relatively easily be turned into latex tables.

   b. "makeBreakoutTable.pro", "makeRegionTable.pro", and "makeTable.pro" explicitly add
      latex headers and footers to those outputs, which can then be copy/pasted into
      a tex file. NB: you have to add the linebreak slashes manually.

4. If a count increased, "findNullWeights.pro" can tell you the CVRTM weights required
   to null that out. It doesn't work for decreases though.
