\noindent {\bf Summary:} Volunteers surveying Eagle Rock and Highland Park on 29 April 2021 found  
a non-significant change in adults experiencing unsheltered homelessness compared to the 2020 
LAHSA Count: $-3\%\pm17\%$ (90\% CI). A 20\% decline in the number of identified rough 
sleepers was offset by an 83\% increase in the number of tents and makeshift dwellings 
(Figure \ref{fig:rawCounts}). This near-doubling of the most visually salient part of unsheltered 
living would support subjective impressions that the state of homelessness worsened despite the 
total population remaining statistically unchanged. Data from the Coordinated Entry System will 
reveal how changes in sheltered homelessness Eagle Rock and Highland Park's total unhoused 
population.
%As COVID-related contractions in health, sanitation, and social 
%services, have deteriorated conditions on the street, such impressions may yet be accurate.

\noindent {\bf Context:} To compensate for the 
\href{https://laist.com/latest/post/20201209/LAHSA-cancels-2021-homeless-count-los-angeles-covid-19}
{cancellation} of the annual LAHSA Count, volunteers in Mid City 
West\footnote{{\bfr ERNC, HHPNC}} conducted a grassroots 
vehicle-based enumeration of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness in that community's 
19 census tracts on April 29, 2021 (Figure \ref{fig:tcomp}, top). Surveying ran from 7:00 PM to 
10:00 PM.\\

\noindent {\bf Results:} The population estimates in Tables \ref{tbl:summary} and \ref{tbl:allTracts} 
reflect all identified persons, cars, vans, RVs, tents, and makeshift structures with each
dwelling weighted by its average occupancy. The weights were set as the area-weighted 
average of those in the LAHSA-defined 
\href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4686-2020-greater-los-angeles-city-community-homelessness-report-service-planning-area-4.pdf}{communities} of Fairfax (30\%), Mid Wilshire (30\%), and 
Beverly Grove (40\%) from which Mid City West is constituted. Results are unchanged if 
the \href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4635-usc-2018-2020-multipliers-and-estimates-overview}
{SPA4/CD5} or \href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4693-2020-greater-los-angeles-homeless-count-cvrtm-conversion-factors}{SPA4-wide} occupancies are used instead, or if the tent weight is 
updated based on a survey performed by {\it The People Concern}.\footnote{Outreach teams 
assessed that 52 people occupied 39 surveyed tents in or around the Mid City West Community,
yielding an estimated $1.33\pm0.18$ people per tent vs.~LAHSA's 2020 value of $1.49\pm0.11$.}

\textbf{Using Monte Carlo methods, Mid City West's unsheltered population is inferred to be 
277 people---17 people higher than 2020's value. However, counting and weighting uncertainties lead
to a 90\% confidence interval of $\mathbf{\pm38}$ people (Figure \ref{fig:tcomp}, bottom). The 
inferred 7\% increase is therefore consistent with Mid City West's \emph{true} unsheltered population 
remaining the same as it was last year. (Indeed, there is a 22\% chance that it decreased.)}
%, such that 22/100 simulated surveys would have found \emph{fewer} unsheltered people compared to last year

Fourteen out of 19 total tracts were counted at least twice (Table \ref{tbl:allTracts}). 
Comparisons of results from these independent surveys show visual 
tally errors to be random, as the analysis assumes. The count uncertainty is $\pm$10\% (95\% CI), 
with the remainder of the $\pm$15\% total population margin of error due to ranges in 
dwelling occupancies.\\

\noindent {\bf Comments:} The above results reflect a $\sim$20\% drop in the number
of adult individuals seen on the street---mirroring trends in neighboring 
\href{https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2021-04-13/despite-appearances-15-fewer-homeless-people-were-on-hollywood-streets-this-year}{Hollywood}---offset by a doubling in tents and 
makeshift structures. Government initiatives to stop evictions and move people indoors may be 
responsible. If \href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4664-2020-homeless-count-council-district-5}{CD5's} 3.4\% share of \href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4585-2020-greater-los-angeles-homeless-count-los-angeles-continuum-of-care-coc-}{LA County's unsheltered seniors} 
is an indication, 60 CD5 residents might have been in any of Project Roomkey's 
\href{https://projectroomkeytracker.com/}{1770 active rooms} on the night of the count, including 
those in the Orlando Hotel. Others
may have been in Pan Pacific Park's COVID-activated emergency beds. Coordinated Entry System data 
will show if the above scenarios are true.

While the number of people on the street may be unchanged, their quality of life has worsened.

COVID has restricted or eliminated access to restaurant bathrooms, libraries 
(\href{https://www.lapl.org/homeless-resources/the-source}{\it The Source}), DPSS 
(EBT, Medi-Cal), DMV (IDs), and DMH facilities. Physical limits on client access at 
hospitals has also kept caseworkers from managing successful discharges. These harms 
are reflected by a 33\% increase in 
\href{http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/chie/reports/HomelessMortality2020_CHIEBrief_Final.pdf}{overdose deaths} and made more visible by \href{https://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2020/20-0147_misc_3-17-20_p.pdf}{suspended}
tent folding and sanitation practices as tents increased.
Of course, with no drop observed with them in place, a substantial rise in unsheltered homelessness
is likely \href{https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-12/new-report-foresees-tens-of-thousands-losing-homes-by-2023}{once the eviction moratoria lapse}.

The data support the effectiveness of programs aimed at curbing a rise in street homelessness.
Yet, they do {\it not} suggest that the state of homelessness has improved. In the fight to rebuild 
lives as we build homes, that fact must remain paramount.
