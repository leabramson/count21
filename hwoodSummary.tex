\noindent {\bf Summary:} A complete census of Hollywood and East Hollywood conducted on February 25, 2021 
suggests that unsheltered homelessness has fallen in these communities by $11\%$ and $15\%$, \resp, since the 
last LAHSA Point-In-Time (PIT) count. A 30\% drop in individuals seen on the street drives this 
change (Figure \ref{fig:rawCounts})---enough to reduce the number of identified persons and dwellings in 
about a third of census tracts (Figure \ref{fig:tcomp}). As this trend holds in tracts assessed by professionals or 
volunteers and is larger than counting errors can account for, a quantitative decline in unsheltered 
living should persist even if the average number of people living in tents or makeshift structures is updated. Data 
from the Coordinated Entry System will reveal whether homelessness has declined in toto, or if COVID-related initiatives 
reduced only the portion of people living unsheltered in Greater Hollywood.

a PIT enumeration of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness to compensate for 
the \href{https://laist.com/latest/post/20201209/LAHSA-cancels-2021-homeless-count-los-angeles-covid-19}
{cancellation} of the official 2021 LAHSA Count. All 39 US Census tracts in the LAHSA-recognized Hollywood 
and East Hollywood communities were surveyed on 25 February (Figure \ref{fig:tcomp}). Nine tracts---comprising 
$\sim$43\% of identified individuals and dwellings---were counted by professional outreach teams during the 
day. The remainder were surveyed by car-based volunteer teams beginning at 7:00 PM.

Each volunteer team was assigned two tracts in one of the communities. Given high turnout, each tract was 
surveyed by at least two teams, increasing the accuracy of the count and enabling better error estimates. Tracts 
surveyed by professionals were counted only once. No volunteer teams and only one professional team counted 
tracts in both communities, making the two datasets almost entirely independent.

Annual trends are consistent across communities and between volunteer- and professional-counted tracts.
Six tracts saw significant population increases; 14 saw declines. E.~Hollywood harbors the tracts with both the
largest increase (1912.01) and decrease (1927.00) since 2020.\\

\noindent {\bf Results and uncertainties:} The population inferences in Table \ref{tbl:summary} and 
Figure \ref{fig:wtComp} reflect 10,000 Monte Carlo resamplings of the survey data with 
counts perturbed randomly by their uncertainties. Counts for cars, vans, RVs, tents, and 
makeshift dwellings (CVRTM) were additionally boosted by the relevant mean occupancy weights 
perturbed by their own uncertainties. The baseline case---quoted in Table \ref{tbl:summary} and 
shown in teal in Figure \ref{fig:wtComp}---adopts the 2020 
\href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4635-usc-2018-2020-multipliers-and-estimates-overview}
{SPA4/CD13 CVRTM weights} underpinning the latest official Hollywood and E.~Hollywood 
\href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4686-2020-greater-los-angeles-city-community-homelessness-report-service-planning-area-4.pdf}
{Community Summaries}, from which we also draw 2020 person and CVRTM raw tallies. Those inferences yield 
$936\pm92$ and $556\pm83$ people experiencing unsheltered homelessness, \resp\ (90\% CI). Modifying the weights
to their 2020 \href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4693-2020-greater-los-angeles-homeless-count-cvrtm-conversion-factors}
{SPA4-wide} values or using data from in-person surveys of tent-dwellers in Hollywood has no
significant effect (Figure \ref{fig:wtComp}), and all estimates suggest at least a 93\% chance of a decline compared
to the 2020 Count.

Nevertheless, the CVRTM weights represent systematic uncertainties: underestimating them would bias
our population estimates low and perhaps erode the declines we infer in both communities. While we encourage
efforts to ascertain current CVRTM occupancies, the declines in unweighted counts are large enough that 
changes from 2020 must be substantial to bring our estimate in-line with last year's. All else being equal, 
the average tent would need to shelter (2.8) 2 people in (East) Hollywood vs.\ 1.5 people in 2020. The average 
makeshift structure would need to shelter (2.5) 2.7 people vs.\ 1.7 people in 2020. Notwithstanding
a 28 February survey in Hollywood that yielded a tent weight consistent with the 2020 value, 
such 30\%--90\% increases in {\it mean} occupancies seem unlikely---especially since known COVID-related
tent distributions by local providers should push in the opposite direction.\footnote{Given the high proportion of people dwelling in tents
and makeshift structures, the $T$ and $M$ weights are the largest potential error sources in this analysis. While 
surveys of the full 2021 PIT area have not been conducted, \href{https://selahnch.org}{\selah} outreach teams 
surveyed of 47 tents (38 responses) in Hollywood on 28 February, yielding a mean occupancy of 
$T=1.39\pm0.14$ people per tent, or $T=1.50\pm0.22$ when non-responses are modeled. While $M$ was
not estimated, both $T$ values are consistent with the official 2020 weight of $T=1.48\pm0.11$.}

Multiple cross-checks suggest that the raw counts from our 2021 PIT count are accurate:
\begin{enumerate}
%	\setlength{\itemsep}{-1ex}
	\item Comparisons of the count's 37 duplicate tract measurements suggest per-tract and per-category
		counting uncertainties are consistent with the random errors built into the analysis.
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item Tract 1901.00---the only outlier in the above comparisons---was independently recounted 
%				14 hours after the PIT count with results consistent with the average of the volunteer teams' 
%				results.
%			\item Tract 1912.01---largest increase---was independently recounted on 27 Feb.\ circa 
%				12:00 PM with results similarly consistent with the PIT teams' assessments.
%			\item Tract 1927.00---largest decrease---was independently recounted on 4 March at 
%				8:30 AM with results lower than the PIT's assessment. This especially dense tract was originally 
%				surveyed on foot by outreach professionals, however, with the recount was performed by a car-based
%				volunteer. The cross-check therefore suggests only that the PIT data are not biased in ways that
%				would induce an artificial year-on-dear decline.				
%		\end{itemize}
	\item External data from \href{https://hollywoodpartnership.com/}{\it The Hollywood Partnership} 
		from 19 Feb.\ are consistent with both the PIT count in a common tract (1902.02) and an independent 
		recount of that entire geography performed 28 Feb.% also show a decline from past values and 
	\item Tracts counted by volunteer and professional teams show consistent trends.
	\item Counts in Hollywood and E.~Hollywood show consistent trends.% (reduced individuals, flat
%		or marginally higher dwelling counts).
	\item Tracts monitored by \selah\ since May 2020 show similar declines to that implied by our data. 
		One of these tracts is 1912.01 in E.~Hollywood, whose 27 Feb.\ \selah\ estimate  agrees with our 
		PIT value.% in unsheltered homelessness.

%The pro/vol trends are consistent everywhere except tract 1927.00, 
%			where pro counts dropped significantly more for both individuals and dwellings (esp.\ 
%			tents). 1927.00 comprises 22\% of total counts in E.~Hollywood. Unsheltered 
%			homelessness in that CoC was flat or rose slightly outside of that tract.}
%{\bfr 1927.00 is the tract with the PATH Madison PSH. Phase II opened in Jan 2020---leasing began May 
%2020---and is 120 units, some of which were filled from nearby folks but I dunno how many. LEA recounted 
%this tract 4 March at $\sim$9:00 AM and found 94 total population vs.\ pro's 129. Only place where
%LEA counted more objects was vans. Adding that to the pro total adds 16 people (9 vans).

All of the above suggests that our results are both quantitatively and qualitatively reliable.\\

\noindent {\bf Comments:} The decline we find is largely driven by a $\sim$30\% drop in observed 
unsheltered individuals in both Hollywood and E.~Hollywood. This reduction may be partially attributable to 
government initiatives aimed at moving people indoors (Project Roomkey) and staunching inflow into homelessness 
(eviction moratoria). Examining Project Roomkey, \href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4672-2020-homeless-count-council-district-13}
{CD13's} share of \href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4585-2020-greater-los-angeles-homeless-count-los-angeles-continuum-of-care-coc-}{LA County's total unsheltered senior population} (6.5\%) implies that perhaps 100 of its 
\href{https://projectroomkeytracker.com/}{1608 occupied rooms} were filled with Greater Hollywood 
residents on the night of the PIT count---enough to account for about half the inferred decline. 
The opening of at least one {\it A Bridge Home} in Los Feliz---whose catchment area includes Hollywood---may 
also have contributed, as may the opening of 120 permanent supportive housing units by PATH in May 2020 
in tract 1927.00. While all of those rooms did not go to local unhoused residents, some may have, thus 
helping drive that tract's large observed decrease. 

Data from the Coordinated Entry System should constrain the above possibilities, revealing whether homelessness 
writ large has fallen since 2020, or just the unsheltered share in Hollywood.

If the numbers have fallen, however, COVID-related closures of restaurants and other facilities that
provided life support to unhoused people (food, hygiene) have substantially degraded conditions 
for those left on the street. Reduced sanitation activities and access to mental health and drug treatment centers 
{\bfr (VERIFY)} have only exacerbated those challenges. Hence, while these data may support the efficacy of 
programs designed to reduce street homelessness, they do not suggest that the state of homelessness 
in Hollywood has improved. In the fight to rebuild lives---as well as build homes---such a fact cannot be forgotten.

%\noindent {\bf Context:} \selah\ volunteers performed two recounts of US Census tract 1975.00 
%on 2 August and 18 October 2020 (Figure \ref{fig:tract}). This tract contains Echo Park Lake and various 
%CalTrans lands. The results of both surveys were statistically identical except for the estimate of vans, 
%which rose from $14\pm3$ to $25\pm5$ between counts. Our final individual/dwelling statistics 
%(Table \ref{tbl:rawData}) and total population estimates (Figure \ref{fig:results}) reflect the average 
%of those assessments.\\

%{\bfr KANAGI: ``we've seen a visual drop; dunno where they went but...'' On 2/18 they found 136 
%total tents in the BID vs our 127 (I haven't vetted the rest of the lines; that's just 12\# hot so w/e). (Also 99
%ppl compared to our 89, and 7 vehicles to our 10 and we weren't tracking those as hard as tents.) 
%On the 5th, they counted 163. That's a 17\% decline in 2 weeks, a little more that what we've seen year on year.
%Suggests maybe something happened in early Feb.? -- 3/2 @ 9:55 AM. The tent+mkshft count in 1902.02 is also 
%right on..}

%Only seven tracts saw significant increases in raw counts, with makeshift dwellings the only category to increase in both CoCs. 

%
%
%Cars and vans are hard to count, but there's no evidence of a bias. I repeated the most deviant tract the next day, 
%and another tract the day after that. In the latter case, both of my estimates were 0.5 units off the mean, in the 
%former, vans were at that level and I counted fewer cars. Brian and I also recovered a consistent amount of vehicles 
%with the BID (10 vs. their 6 separated by 20+ days). The rest of the tracts show a mean inter-counter bias of 0.6 
%cars (0.4 std.~err) and 1.24 ($0.76\sigma$) vans across all tracts, which should be accounted for in the MC.


% Pro teams counted areas comprising $\sim$43\% of the total raw counts. Three out of these 4 tracts 
% were counted by Covenant House teams, but 1927.00 has the largest drop of any tract and is Elyse 
% from The Center. That tract is basically responsible for the entire decline in E.~Hollywood, and most 
% of that is in reduced tents, so we should 	talk to these teams.
