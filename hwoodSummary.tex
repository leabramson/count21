\noindent {\bf Summary:} February 25, 2021 censuses of Hollywood and East Hollywood suggest that 
unsheltered homelessness has fallen in those communities by $10\%$ and $15\%$, \resp, compared to 
the 2020 LAHSA Count. A 30\% drop in people seen on the street drives this change 
(Figure \ref{fig:rawCounts}). At the same time, however, tents doubled in 28\% of US Census tracts. 
This phenomenon might drive subjective impressions that the state of homelessness has 
worsened. Given COVID-related contractions in health, hygiene, and social services, those 
perceptions are likely to be accurate despite a drop in raw numbers. 
Data from the Coordinated Entry System data will reveal if homelessness has declined 
generally, or if government initiatives have reduced Greater Hollywood's share of it.

a census of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness on 25 Feb.~to compensate for 
the \href{https://laist.com/latest/post/20201209/LAHSA-cancels-2021-homeless-count-los-angeles-covid-19}
{cancellation} of the official 2021 Count. All 40 census tracts in the LAHSA-defined Hollywood 
and East Hollywood communities were surveyed, mainly between 7:00 and 10:00 PM (Figure \ref{fig:tcomp}). 
%Nine tracts were counted by professional outreach teams during the %---comprising $\sim$43\% of identified individuals and dwellings---
%day. The remainder were surveyed by car-based volunteer teams starting at 7:00 PM.

Each volunteer team counted two tracts. To increase the accuracy of our count, each tract was counted by at 
least two teams. 
%Tracts counted by professionals were assessed only once. No 
%volunteers and only one professional team counted tracts in both communities, making the two datasets 
%almost entirely independent.
%and enabling better error estimates
%Year-on-year trends hold across communities and between volunteer- and professional-counted tracts.
Seven tracts saw significant increases; 14 saw declines. The tracts with the largest increase (1912.01;
Barnsdall Park) and decrease (1927.00; US 101) are both in East Hollywood.\\

\noindent {\bf Results and uncertainties:} Table \ref{tbl:summary}'s population estimates  %and Figure \ref{fig:wtComp} 
come from our count data with tallies for cars, vans, RVs, tents, and makeshift dwellings weighted by 
their average number of occupants. Our baseline result uses the same %quoted in Table \ref{tbl:summary} and shown in teal in Figure \ref{fig:wtComp}
\href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4635-usc-2018-2020-multipliers-and-estimates-overview}
{SPA4/CD13 weights} as the last official 
\href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4686-2020-greater-los-angeles-city-community-homelessness-report-service-planning-area-4.pdf}
{Community Summaries}. 
%These suggest $\nh$ and $\ne$ people were experiencing unsheltered 
%homelessness, \resp, on 25 Feb.\ (90\% CI). 
Changing the weights based on a survey of tent-dwellers or using the last 
\href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4693-2020-greater-los-angeles-homeless-count-cvrtm-conversion-factors}{SPA4-wide} values has no significant effect:
%\footnote{Those inferences yield $912\pm68$ and $944\pm118$ people
%in Hollywood, and $539\pm59$ and $559\pm87$ in E.~Hollywood, \resp.} 
all suggest at least an 89\% chance of a decline compared to 2020.
 % (Figure \ref{fig:wtComp})

The weights are still uncertainties, but the size of the drop in unweighted counts means that,
to erase the trend we find, tents and makeshifts must now shelter 2.1 and 2.5 people on average 
compared to 1.5 and 1.7 people last year. At least since 2018, such a large change has 
never been seen, and the aforementioned tent survey---which showed a value 
consistent with 2020's---makes it more unlikely.\footnote{\selah\ outreach teams surveyed 47 tents in 
Hollywood on 28 Feb., finding an average of $1.50\pm0.22$ people per tent. This value is 
consistent with the LAHSA 2020 weight of $1.48\pm0.11$.}
%however. If the average tent, e.g., holds more people today 
%compared to last year, then part of the inferred population decrease may be an artifact.
%\footnote{The $T$ and $M$ weights are the largest 
%potential errors in this analysis due to the high proportion of people living in tents and makeshift structures. 
%The full 2021 PIT area has not been assessed, but \selah\ outreach teams surveyed 47 tents (38 responses) in 
%Hollywood on 28 Feb., finding a mean occupancy of $T=1.39\pm0.14$ people per tent ($T=1.50\pm0.22$ if 
%non-responses are modeled). $M$ was not estimated, but that $T$ value is consistent with the LAHSA 2020 
%weight of $T=1.48\pm0.11$. We encourage larger efforts to update the CVRTM weights.} 
%the occupancy increases needed to erase our estimated changes are
%substantial. 

Other cross-checks suggest that our 2021 PIT enumeration is accurate:
\begin{enumerate}
%	\setlength{\itemsep}{-1ex}
	\item Our 38 duplicate tract measurements suggest counting uncertainties are consistent with random 
		errors, which the analysis accounts for.
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item Tract 1901.00---the only outlier in the above comparisons---was independently recounted 
%				14 hours after the PIT count with results consistent with the average of the volunteer teams' 
%				results.
%			\item Tract 1912.01---largest increase---was independently recounted on 27 Feb.\ circa 
%				12:00 PM with results similarly consistent with the PIT teams' assessments.
%			\item Tract 1927.00---largest decrease---was independently recounted on 4 March at 
%				8:30 AM with results lower than the PIT's assessment. This especially dense tract was originally 
%				surveyed on foot by outreach professionals, however, with the recount was performed by a car-based
%				volunteer. The cross-check therefore suggests only that the PIT data are not biased in ways that
%				would induce an artificial year-on-dear decline.				
%		\end{itemize}
	\item A census by \href{https://hollywoodpartnership.com/}{\it The Hollywood Partnership} 
		from 19 Feb.\ agrees with our data in a common tract.% and an independent 
%		recount of that entire geography performed 28 Feb.% also show a decline from past values and 
	\item Trends are common to Hollywood and East Hollywood despite being counted by different teams.%in tracts counted by volunteers and professionals
	% (reduced individuals, flat
%		or marginally higher dwelling counts).
%	\item Tracts monitored by \selah\ since May 2020 show similar declines to that implied by our data. 
%		One of these tracts is 1912.01 in East Hollywood, whose 27 Feb.\ \selah\ estimate  agrees with our 
%		PIT value.% in unsheltered homelessness.

% 1907.00 is also interesting in that total population stayed nearly the same but identified
% individuals and dwellings basically swapped: IND 73->38; CVRTM 31->70. This has a big impact
% on people's perceptions, and it's in a very high-traffic part of the community.

%The pro/vol trends are consistent everywhere except tract 1927.00, 
%			where pro counts dropped significantly more for both individuals and dwellings (esp.\ 
%			tents). 1927.00 comprises 22\% of total counts in East Hollywood. Unsheltered 
%			homelessness in that CoC was flat or rose slightly outside of that tract.}
%{\bfr 1927.00 is the tract with the PATH Madison PSH. Phase II opened in Jan 2020---leasing began May 
%2020---and is 120 units, some of which were filled from nearby folks but I dunno how many. LEA recounted 
%this tract 4 March at $\sim$9:00 AM and found 94 total population vs.\ pro's 129. Only place where
%LEA counted more objects was vans. Adding that to the pro total adds 16 people (9 vans).

Finally, if the 80 car and van dwellers that might have been at safe parking sites are added to our estimate, 
the chance of a decline from 2020 is still 88\%. All of the above suggests that our results are reliable.\\
%Assumes equal mix of cars + vans.
%From Starkey: Hwood = 25, Eho = 10, EchoPk = 14; total = 49; total CD13 = 59 but I think it's reasonable
%to truncate at Echo Pk. It's 90% if you include all 59 spaces.

\noindent {\bf Comments:} The drop we find mainly reflects $\sim$30\% fewer individuals seen on the 
street. Government initiatives to move people indoors and stop evictions may be 
responsible. Indeed, if \href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4672-2020-homeless-count-council-district-13}{CD13's} 6.5\% share of \href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4585-2020-greater-los-angeles-homeless-count-los-angeles-continuum-of-care-coc-}{LA County's unsheltered seniors} is an indication, perhaps 
100 Greater Hollywood residents occupied Project Roomkey's 
\href{https://projectroomkeytracker.com/}{1608 active rooms} on the night of our count---about 
half the inferred change. The new Riverside \href{https://www.lamayor.org/ABridgeHome}
{\it A Bridge Home} and 120 PATH supportive housing units may also have contributed.
%The latter are located in tract 1927.00. While all of those units did not go to local residents, any that did would help
%drive that tract's large observed decrease. 
Coordinated Entry System data will reveal if those scenarios are true.
%1927.00 is actually in the catchment of 3 ABHs that were either new or expanded between PIT counts. 
%Lodi, however, did not fill its new beds, and Lafayette doesn't cover the whole tract, so we won't speculate.
%Nevertheless, technically, even at 50\% decompression, residents of 1927.00 may have been eligible 
%for any of 89 new ABH beds. It's also on the CoC boundary.

If there are fewer people on the street today, though, their quality of life is worse. 
COVID has restricted or eliminated access to restaurant and park bathrooms, libraries (and 
\href{https://www.lapl.org/homeless-resources/the-source}{\it The Source} service days), DPSS 
(EBT, Medi-Cal), DMV (ID replacement), and DMH facilities. Physical limits on client access at 
hospitals and clinics has also kept caseworkers from managing successful discharges. These harms 
are reflected by a 25\% increase in 
\href{https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-07/the-powerful-synthetic-opioid-fentanyl-is-behind-rising-deaths-in-the-homeless-population}{overdose deaths} and made more visible by a doubling of 
tents in 28\% of tracts %\footnote{Including 1907.00, Central Hollywood's commercial core.} 
as tent folding laws and sanitation programs were  
\href{https://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2020/20-0147_misc_3-17-20_p.pdf}{suspended}. Of course,
the $\sim$10\% decline we measure does not necessarily bode well for the period \href{https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-12/new-report-foresees-tens-of-thousands-losing-homes-by-2023}
{after the eviction moratoriums end}.

So, while our census may support the effectiveness of programs designed to reduce street homelessness, 
they do {\it not} suggest that the state of homelessness has improved. In the fight to rebuild lives---as well 
as build homes---that fact must remain paramount.\\

% {\bfr Five ABH's cover Greater Hollywood,
%three have catchment areas covering 1927.00. Their net addition is 33 beds, total, but 89 in that tract (whose
%net gain is eroded by losses of preexisting beds from Schrader and Garnder in the west).}

%DPSS closed; phone system with long waits req'd to replace EBT. If you don't have a phone your stuck.

%Libraries are closed, and therefore {\it The Source} service connection events. 
%Daytime charity resources and some parks are closed, resulting in more exposure to the weather and less food.

%Med-Cal not accessible via DPSS. Enrolling in health insurance requires similar phone calls and that a state 
%ID be uploaded (previously not required). Lacking insurance affects likelihood and length of admission to hospital. 
%Discharges requiring skilled or recuperative care placements are even more difficult.

%DMV is by appointment only and appointments are made online.

%DMH clinic services done via telehealth, leaving homeless clients hanging. One FSP has abandoned all field work due to COVID. 
%Clients in crisis needing evaluations redirected to hospitals.

%Hospitals, IMD's step down facilities and SNF's do not allow visitors, limiting the ability of case managers to negotiate 
%with clients and social workers to ensure successful discharges. Consent forms for sharing info cannot be signed by patients 
%due to lack of access.
%
%Homeless people have gotten sicker while hospitals and LAFD have become overburdened dealing with COVID fallout, 
%resulting in less access to emergency care.

%{\bfr KANAGI: ``we've seen a visual drop; dunno where they went but...'' On 2/18 they found 136 
%total tents in the BID vs our 127 (I haven't vetted the rest of the lines; that's just 12\# hot so w/e). (Also 99
%ppl compared to our 89, and 7 vehicles to our 10 and we weren't tracking those as hard as tents.) 
%On the 5th, they counted 163. That's a 17\% decline in 2 weeks, a little more that what we've seen year on year.
%Suggests maybe something happened in early Feb.? -- 3/2 @ 9:55 AM. The tent+mkshft count in 1902.02 is also 
%right on..}

%Only seven tracts saw significant increases in raw counts, with makeshift dwellings the only category to increase in both CoCs. 

%Cars and vans are hard to count, but there's no evidence of a bias. I repeated the most deviant tract the next day, 
%and another tract the day after that. In the latter case, both of my estimates were 0.5 units off the mean, in the 
%former, vans were at that level and I counted fewer cars. Brian and I also recovered a consistent amount of vehicles 
%with the BID (10 vs. their 6 separated by 20+ days). The rest of the tracts show a mean inter-counter bias of 0.6 
%cars (0.4 std.~err) and 1.24 ($0.76\sigma$) vans across all tracts, which should be accounted for in the MC.

% Pro teams counted areas comprising $\sim$43\% of the total raw counts. Three out of these 4 tracts 
% were counted by Covenant House teams, but 1927.00 has the largest drop of any tract and is Elyse 
% from The Center. That tract is basically responsible for the entire decline in East Hollywood, and most 
% of that is in reduced tents, so we should 	talk to these teams.
