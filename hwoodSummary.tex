\noindent {\bf Summary:} The number of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness in both Hollywood 
and East Hollywood has fallen since the last LAHSA Point-In-Time count in January 2020. Based on data 
from the night of 25 February 2021, we estimate decreases of $11\%\pm9\%$ and $15\%\pm12\%$ (90\% CI), 
\resp, assuming no changes in average dwelling occupancies; i.e., at least a 93\% chance of a decline.

A $\sim$30\% reduction in persons seen on the street drives this change (Figure \ref{fig:rawCounts}), which is 
sufficient to significantly lower {\it raw counts} of individuals and dwellings in 14 out of 39 census tracts (Figure 
\ref{fig:tcomp}). 
This trend is independent of counters (professional vs.\ volunteer) and is larger than what data acquisition errors 
will admit. A qualitative decline in unsheltered living should therefore be robust to reasonable changes in 
demographic weights, which at least one preliminary survey suggests may be modest.
%Only seven tracts saw significant increases in raw counts, with makeshift dwellings the only category to increase in both CoCs. 

Data from the Coordinated Entry System will reveal whether homelessness has declined in toto, or, alternately,
if COVID-related government initiatives reduced the proportion of people living without shelter.

Cars and vans are hard to count, but there's no evidence of a bias. I repeated the most deviant tract the next day, 
and another tract the day after that. In the latter case, both of my estimates were 0.5 units off the mean, in the 
former, vans were at that level and I counted fewer cars. Brian and I also recovered a consistent amount of vehicles 
with the BID (10 vs. their 6 separated by 20+ days). The rest of the tracts show a mean inter-counter bias of 0.6 
cars (0.4 std.~err) and 1.24 ($0.76\sigma$) vans across all tracts, which should be accounted for in the MC.

%\noindent {\bf Context:} \selah\ volunteers performed two recounts of US Census tract 1975.00 
%on 2 August and 18 October 2020 (Figure \ref{fig:tract}). This tract contains Echo Park Lake and various 
%CalTrans lands. The results of both surveys were statistically identical except for the estimate of vans, 
%which rose from $14\pm3$ to $25\pm5$ between counts. Our final individual/dwelling statistics 
%(Table \ref{tbl:rawData}) and total population estimates (Figure \ref{fig:results}) reflect the average 
%of those assessments.\\


\noindent {\bf Results and uncertainties:} The population inferences in Figure \ref{fig:results} come 
from 10,000 Monte Carlo resamplings of the \selah\ survey data with counts perturbed by random 
draws from their Poisson error bars. In the cases of cars, vans, RVs, tents, and makeshift (CVRTM) 
dwellings, we additionally boosted counts by the relevant weighting factor perturbed by its error bar. 
In the baseline case---shown as blue horizontal bands in Figure \ref{fig:results}---we use the official 2020 
\href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4693-2020-greater-los-angeles-homeless-count-cvrtm-conversion-factors}{LAHSA SPA4 CVRTM weights}. The median result of that inference yields $220\pm30$ unsheltered 
individuals (90\% CI) compared to the PIT's estimate of 174 people.\\
\indent The CVRTM weights present systematic uncertainties, however, and so possible biases. 
For example, service providers have made a concerted effort to distribute tents during COVID, 
which might modulate $T$ downwards. (Other weights may have also shifted, but the fraction of 
tent-dwelling is such that changes to $T$ dominate the measurement error.) As such, multiplying by the 
2020 LAHSA tent weight may result in an overestimate of the actual unsheltered population.\\
\indent \selah\ cannot re-measure $T$ on large geographies, but two small-scale estimates 
suggest it has indeed fallen from the official 2020 value of 1.45 people per tent:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \selah\ outreach teams surveyed 30 tents along Echo Park Lake's southern border on 21 
	February 2021, finding 11 of them to be used for storage or---based on statements from 
	neighbors or the team's weekly experience---abandoned. Albeit small, this sampling suggests that 
	up to 28\%--45\% of tents may be uninhabited (95\% CI) effectively reducing $T$ to 0.9.\footnote{
	Note: the official CVRTM weights are established using a 
	\href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4658-usc-2020-homeless-count-methodology-report}{methodology} that may not account for empty tents, and therefore may generally lead to overestimates of
	some degree.}
	\item Business Improvement District surveys of Hollywood conducted biweekly since January 2020 
	show the number of tents to have risen there faster than the number of visible individuals. Those
	data imply an average tent occupancy of $T=1.1\pm0.07$ people today.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent Using the lower unoccupied tent fraction in (1) to allow for inhabitants simply not being home, both 
modifications reduce our median unsheltered estimate to about 190 people---16 more than the 2020 PIT value.

\indent In all cases, further rigorous surveys---especially those aimed at understanding the fraction of
tents not used as  dwellings---are needed to ensure we understand the current scale of the 
homelessness crisis and plan accordingly.

We attribute this phenomenon to a combination of government initiatives aimed at both moving unhoused
residents indoors---e.g., Project Roomkey---and keeping housed people in their homes---e.g., City and State
eviction moratoria. 

\href{https://projectroomkeytracker.com/}{PRK Tracker; 1608 near night of count}
\href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4686-2020-greater-los-angeles-city-community-homelessness-report-service-planning-area-4.pdf}{LAHSA stats from this report}

{\bfr If Hwood and Eho's share of total LACo unsheltered homelessness are good proxies, something
like 60 formerly unsheltered ppl may have been in Roomkey the night of the count (1608 occupied rooms). 
Unclear how much of this was for folks in ABH, which would not reflect a net increase of sheltered ppl.}

Instead, the decline we observe may partially reflect a combination of COVID-related initiatives aimed at placing 
and keeping people in housing. Eviction moratoria may have reduced inflow while Project Roomkey, various 
emergency shelters, and the opening of at least one {\it A Bridge Home} site may have moved people indoors. If so, 
homelessness in toto may not have decreased despite a decline in the fraction of people living without shelter. 


This decrease is seen in raw counts and inferred total
population, in tracts counted by volunteers and professionals, in adjacent geographies counted by independent
teams, and at a level that cannot be accounted for by data acquisition errors. Recent observations suggesting
reduced tent occupancies during COVID only exacerbate the decline, which can be reversed only by assuming
a failure to count cars and vans used as dwellings that is not supported by cross-counter comparisons.

{\bfr KANAGI: ``we've seen a visual drop; dunno where they went but...'' On 2/18 they found 136 
total tents in the BID vs our 127 (I haven't vetted the rest of the lines; that's just 12\# hot so w/e). (Also 99
ppl compared to our 89, and 7 vehicles to our 10 and we weren't tracking those as hard as tents.) 
On the 5th, they counted 163. That's a 17\% decline in 2 weeks, a little more that what we've seen year on year.
Suggests maybe something happened in early Feb.? -- 3/2 @ 9:55 AM. The tent+mkshft count in 1902.02 is also 
right on.

62+ is 13\% of SPA4 unsheltered pop in 2020 (513/3911).}

Moreover, given the closure
of many facilities used by unhoused people for basic functions, conditions for those remaining on the street may
have deteriorated markedly. 

However, while the numbers may have declined since the onset of the pandemic, conditions on the street
have likely
