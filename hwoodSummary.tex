\noindent {\bf Summary:} The number of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness in both Hollywood 
and East Hollywood has fallen since the last LAHSA Point-In-Time (PIT) count in January 2020. %(1/23)
Using a complete census of these communities from 25 February 2021, we estimate decreases of 
$11\%\pm9\%$ and $15\%\pm12\%$ (90\% CI), \resp, suggesting at least a 93\% chance of a decline.
%assuming no changes in average dwelling occupancies, 

A $\sim$30\% reduction in persons seen on the street drives this change (Figure \ref{fig:rawCounts})---enough 
to lower {\it raw counts} of individuals and dwellings in about a third of census tracts (Figure \ref{fig:tcomp}). 
This trend is independent of whether counters were professionals or volunteers and is larger than what data acquisition 
errors will admit. A qualitative decline in unsheltered living is thus likely to persist even given reasonable 
changes in demographic weights, which one preliminary survey suggests may be modest. 
%Only seven tracts saw significant increases in raw counts, with makeshift dwellings the only category to increase in both CoCs. 
%All data are available to support future analyses incorporating such information.

Data from the Coordinated Entry System will reveal whether homelessness has declined in toto, or if
COVID-related initiatives reduced only the portion of people living unsheltered in Greater Hollywood.

a PIT enumeration of people experiencing unsheltered homelessness to compensate for 
the \href{https://laist.com/latest/post/20201209/LAHSA-cancels-2021-homeless-count-los-angeles-covid-19}
{cancellation} of the official 2021 countywide count. All 39 US Census tracts in the LAHSA-recognized Hollywood 
and East Hollywood communities were surveyed on 25 February (Figure \ref{fig:tcomp}). Nine tracts---comprising 
$\sim$43\% of total individuals and dwellings identified---were counted by professional outreach teams during the 
day. The remainder were surveyed by car-based volunteer teams beginning at 7:00 PM.

Each volunteer team was assigned two tracts in either Hollywood or E.~Hollywood. Since 32 teams 
turned-out, each tract was counted by at least two independent teams. Such redundancy increased the 
count's accuracy and enabled better error assessments. Tracts surveyed by professionals were 
counted only once. Zero volunteer teams and only professional team counted tracts in both 
communities, enabling trends to be cross-validated across nearly independent datasets.

Year-on-year trends are consistent across communities and between volunteer- and professionally counted tracts.
Six tracts saw significant inferred population increases; 14 significant declines. The largest 
increase was observed by volunteers; the largest decrease by professionals (both in E.~Hollywood).\\

\noindent {\bf Results and uncertainties:} The population inferences in Table \ref{tbl:summary} and 
Figure \ref{fig:wtComp} reflect 10,000 Monte Carlo resamplings of the survey data with 
counts perturbed randomly by their uncertainties. Counts for cars, vans, RVs, tents, and 
makeshift dwellings (CVRTM) were additionally boosted by the relevant demographic weights 
perturbed by their own uncertainties. The baseline case---quoted in Table \ref{tbl:summary} and 
shown in teal in Figure \ref{fig:wtComp}---adopts the 2020 
\href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4635-usc-2018-2020-multipliers-and-estimates-overview}
{SPA4/CD13 CVRTM weights} underpinning the latest official Hollywood and E.~Hollywood 
\href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4686-2020-greater-los-angeles-city-community-homelessness-report-service-planning-area-4.pdf}
{Community Summaries}, from which we also draw raw 2020 person and CVRTM tallies. Those inferences yield 
$936\pm92$ and $556\pm83$ people experiencing unsheltered homelessness, \resp\ (90\% CI). Modifying the weights
to their 2020 \href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4693-2020-greater-los-angeles-homeless-count-cvrtm-conversion-factors}
{SPA4-wide} values or using data from in-person surveys of tent-dwellers in Hollywood has no
significant effect (Figure \ref{fig:wtComp}).

Nevertheless, the CVRTM weights represent systematic uncertainties: underestimating them would bias
our population estimates low and perhaps erode the declines we infer in both communities. We encourage robust
efforts to ascertain current CVRTM occupancies, but the declines in unweighted counts are large enough that 
the changes from 2020 must be substantial to bring our estimate in-line with last year's. All else being equal, 
the average tent would need to shelter (2.8) 2 people in (East) Hollywood vs.\ 1.5 people in 2020. Meanwhile, 
the average makeshift structure would need to shelter (2.5) 2.7 people vs.\ 1.7 people in 2020. Notwithstanding
a 28 February survey of tents in Hollywood that yielded a tent occupancy consistent with the 2020 value, 
such 30\%--90\% increases {\it in the mean} seem unlikely, especially when known tent distribution efforts 
during COVID should push in the opposite direction.\footnote{Given the high proportion of people dwelling in tents
and makeshift structures, the $T$ and $M$ weights are the largest potential error sources in this analysis. While 
surveys of the full 2021 PIT area have not been conducted, \href{https://selahnch.org}{\selah} outreach teams 
surveyed of 47 tents (38 responses) in Hollywood on 28 February, yielding a mean occupancy of 
$T=1.39\pm0.14$ people per tent, or $T=1.50\pm0.22$ when non-responses are modeled. While $M$ was
not estimated, both $T$ values are consistent with the official 2020 weight of $T=1.48\pm0.11$.}

Numerous cross-checks give us confidence that the raw counts, too, are unbiased:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Comparisons of the PIT's 37 duplicate tract measurements suggest per-tract and per-category
		counting errors are consistent with the Poisson uncertainties built into the analysis.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Tract 1901.00---the only outlier in the above comparisons---was independently recounted 
				at 9.00 AM 14 hours after the PIT count with results consistent with the average 
				of the PIT volunteer teams' results (adopted in the analysis).
			\item Tract 1912.01---exhibiting the largest year-on-year increase---was independently recounted
				on 27 Feb.\ circa 12.00 PM with results similarly consistent with the PIT teams' assessments.
			\item Tract 1927.00---exhibiting the largest year-on-year decrease---was independently recounted
				on 4 March at 8.30 AM with results lower than the PIT assessment. However, the PIT
				survey was done on foot in this especially dense tract while the recount was done by a single
				counter in a vehicle. The recount therefore only suggests the PIT value is not an underestimate.
		\end{itemize}
	\item External data from {\it The Hollywood Partnership} from 19 Feb.\ also show a decline from past values 
		in that geography and are consistent with both the PIT count from one isolatable common tract 
		(1902.02) and an independent survey of the entire footprint performed 28 Feb.
	\item Comparisons of the pro- and volunteer-counted tracts show consistent trends vs.\ 2020.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Trends in Greater Hollywood are also consistent with those in 4 tracts
				monitored by \selah.
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Taken together, all of the above suggests the all-volunteer count is no less accurate in terms of people and
dwellings enumerated than previous official counts. To the best of our ability to assess, it should be similarly
accurate in population estimate, though larger surveys of the average occupancy of especially makeshift 
structures would be necessary to verify this statement.

\section{Discussion}

We attribute this phenomenon to a combination of government initiatives aimed at both moving unhoused
residents indoors---e.g., Project Roomkey---and keeping housed people in their homes---e.g., City and State
eviction moratoria. 

\href{https://projectroomkeytracker.com/}{PRK Tracker; 1608 near night of count}
\href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4686-2020-greater-los-angeles-city-community-homelessness-report-service-planning-area-4.pdf}{LAHSA stats from this report}

{\bfr If Hwood and Eho's share of total LACo unsheltered homelessness are good proxies, something
like 60 formerly unsheltered ppl may have been in Roomkey the night of the count (1608 occupied rooms). 
Unclear how much of this was for folks in ABH, which would not reflect a net increase of sheltered ppl.}

Instead, the decline we observe may partially reflect a combination of COVID-related initiatives aimed at placing 
and keeping people in housing. Eviction moratoria may have reduced inflow while Project Roomkey, various 
emergency shelters, and the opening of at least one {\it A Bridge Home} site may have moved people indoors. If so, 
homelessness in toto may not have decreased despite a decline in the fraction of people living without shelter. 

{\bfr KANAGI: ``we've seen a visual drop; dunno where they went but...'' On 2/18 they found 136 
total tents in the BID vs our 127 (I haven't vetted the rest of the lines; that's just 12\# hot so w/e). (Also 99
ppl compared to our 89, and 7 vehicles to our 10 and we weren't tracking those as hard as tents.) 
On the 5th, they counted 163. That's a 17\% decline in 2 weeks, a little more that what we've seen year on year.
Suggests maybe something happened in early Feb.? -- 3/2 @ 9:55 AM. The tent+mkshft count in 1902.02 is also 
right on.

62+ is 13\% of SPA4 unsheltered pop in 2020 (513/3911).}

%Only seven tracts saw significant increases in raw counts, with makeshift dwellings the only category to increase in both CoCs. 

{\bfr in E.\ Hollywood. The pro/vol trends are consistent everywhere except that tract, 
			where pro counts dropped significantly more for both individuals and dwellings (esp.\ 
			tents). 1927.00 comprises 22\% of total counts in E.~Hollywood. Unsheltered 
			homelessness in that CoC was flat or rose slightly outside of that tract.}
{\bfr 1927.00 is the tract with the PATH Madison PSH. Phase II opened in Jan 2020---leasing began May 
2020---and is 120 units, some of which were filled from nearby folks but I dunno how many. LEA recounted 
this tract 4 March at $\sim$9:00 AM and found 94 total population vs.\ pro's 129. Only place where
LEA counted more objects was vans. Adding that to the pro total adds 16 people (9 vans).}

Moreover, given the closure
of many facilities used by unhoused people for basic functions, conditions for those remaining on the street may
have deteriorated markedly. 

However, while the numbers may have declined since the onset of the pandemic, conditions on the street
have likely 


Cars and vans are hard to count, but there's no evidence of a bias. I repeated the most deviant tract the next day, 
and another tract the day after that. In the latter case, both of my estimates were 0.5 units off the mean, in the 
former, vans were at that level and I counted fewer cars. Brian and I also recovered a consistent amount of vehicles 
with the BID (10 vs. their 6 separated by 20+ days). The rest of the tracts show a mean inter-counter bias of 0.6 
cars (0.4 std.~err) and 1.24 ($0.76\sigma$) vans across all tracts, which should be accounted for in the MC.


% Pro teams counted areas comprising $\sim$43\% of the total raw counts. Three out of these 4 tracts 
% were counted by Covenant House teams, but 1927.00 has the largest drop of any tract and is Elyse 
% from The Center. That tract is basically responsible for the entire decline in E.~Hollywood, and most 
% of that is in reduced tents, so we should 	talk to these teams.
