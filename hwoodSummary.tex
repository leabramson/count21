\noindent {\bf Summary:} A February 25, 2021 census of Hollywood and East Hollywood suggests that 
unsheltered homelessness has fallen in those communities by $11\%$ and $15\%$, \resp, compared to 
the 2020 LAHSA Point-In-Time (PIT) count. A 30\% drop in individuals seen on the street drives this 
change (Figure \ref{fig:rawCounts}), reducing the number of identified persons and dwellings in 
about a third of census tracts. Unsheltered living is thus likely to have declined quantitatively even if the 
average number of people living, e.g., in tents is updated. {\bfp However, 13\% of tracts
saw at least a doubling in street dwellings. This trend may contribute to qualitative perceptions that the 
state of homelessness has worsened over the past year, which---given real COVID-related reductions in 
health, hygiene, and social support services---are also likely to be accurate.} Coordinated Entry System data will 
reveal whether homelessness has declined in toto or if government initiatives reduced only the portion of 
people living unsheltered in Greater Hollywood.
%This trend holds in tracts assessed by professionals or volunteers and is larger 
%than counting errors can account for.
% less than a 93\% chance that 
%with at least one preliminary survey suggesting such updates may be modest
%the number of unsheltered people has fallen by at least some amount. %\pm9\% %\pm12\%
%(1/23)
%assuming no changes in average dwelling occupancies, 
%Only seven tracts saw significant increases in raw counts, with makeshift dwellings the only category to increase in both CoCs. 
%All data are available to support future analyses incorporating such information.

{cancellation} of the official 2021 Count. All 39 US Census tracts in the LAHSA-recognized Hollywood 
and East Hollywood communities were surveyed on 25 February (Figure \ref{fig:tcomp}). Nine tracts 
were counted by professional outreach teams during the %---comprising $\sim$43\% of identified individuals and dwellings---
day. The remainder were surveyed by car-based volunteer teams beginning at 7:00 PM.

Each volunteer team was assigned two tracts in one of the communities. Given high turnout, each tract was 
surveyed by at least two teams, increasing the accuracy of the count. Tracts 
surveyed by professionals were counted only once. No volunteer teams and only one professional team counted 
tracts in both communities, making the two datasets almost entirely independent.
%and enabling better error estimates

Year-on-year trends are consistent across communities and between volunteer- and professional-counted tracts.
Six tracts saw significant population increases and 14 saw declines. The tracts with the largest increase (1912.01;
Barnsdall Park) and decrease (1927.00; US Rte.\ 101) are both in East Hollywood.\\

\noindent {\bf Results and uncertainties:} The population inferences in Table \ref{tbl:summary} %and Figure \ref{fig:wtComp} 
reflect 10,000 Monte Carlo resamplings of the survey data with 
counts perturbed randomly by their uncertainties. Counts for cars, vans, RVs, tents, and 
makeshift dwellings (CVRTM) were additionally boosted by the relevant mean occupancy weights 
perturbed by their own uncertainties. The baseline case adopts the 2020 
%quoted in Table \ref{tbl:summary} and shown in teal in Figure \ref{fig:wtComp}

\href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4686-2020-greater-los-angeles-city-community-homelessness-report-service-planning-area-4.pdf}
{Community Summaries}, from which we also draw 2020's person and CVRTM raw tallies. Those inferences yield 
$936\pm92$ and $556\pm83$ people experiencing unsheltered homelessness, \resp\ (90\% CI). Modifying the weights
to their 2020 \href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4693-2020-greater-los-angeles-homeless-count-cvrtm-conversion-factors}
{SPA4-wide} values or using data from in-person surveys of tent-dwellers in Hollywood has no
significant effect.\footnote{Those inferences suggest $912\pm68$ and $944\pm118$ people
in Hollywood, and $539\pm59$ and $559\pm87$ in East Hollywood, \resp, consistent with baseline results.} 
All estimates suggest at least a 93\% chance of a decline compared to the 2020 PIT count.
 % (Figure \ref{fig:wtComp})

Nevertheless, the CVRTM weights are systematic uncertainties: if the average tent or makeshift structure holds
more people today compared to last year, then the inferred population decrease may be artificial. Given the drop in 
unweighted counts, however, those dwellings' {\it average} occupancies must have risen to 2.2 and 2.6 people 
from 1.5 and 1.7 people, \resp, to erase the decline. Such $\sim$50\% increases in the mean seem unlikely given 
known COVID-related tent distribution efforts---which push in the opposite direction---and a 28 Feb.\ tent 
survey yielding a weight consistent with 2020's value.\footnote{The $T$ and $M$ weights are the largest 
potential error sources in this analysis due to the high proportion of people living in tents and makeshift structures. 
While the full 2021 PIT area has not been assessed, \selah\ outreach teams surveyed 47 tents (38 responses) in 
Hollywood on 28 Feb., yielding a mean occupancy of $T=1.39\pm0.14$ people per tent ($T=1.50\pm0.22$ when 
non-responses are modeled). Although $M$ was not estimated, that $T$ value is consistent with the official 2020 
weight of $T=1.48\pm0.11$. We encourage more robust efforts to update the CVRTM weights.} 
%the occupancy increases needed to erase our estimated changes are
%substantial. 

Multiple cross-checks suggest that the raw counts from our 2021 PIT enumeration are accurate:
\begin{enumerate}
%	\setlength{\itemsep}{-1ex}
	\item Comparisons of the count's 37 duplicate tract measurements suggest per-tract and per-category
		counting uncertainties are consistent with the random errors built into the analysis.
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item Tract 1901.00---the only outlier in the above comparisons---was independently recounted 
%				14 hours after the PIT count with results consistent with the average of the volunteer teams' 
%				results.
%			\item Tract 1912.01---largest increase---was independently recounted on 27 Feb.\ circa 
%				12:00 PM with results similarly consistent with the PIT teams' assessments.
%			\item Tract 1927.00---largest decrease---was independently recounted on 4 March at 
%				8:30 AM with results lower than the PIT's assessment. This especially dense tract was originally 
%				surveyed on foot by outreach professionals, however, with the recount was performed by a car-based
%				volunteer. The cross-check therefore suggests only that the PIT data are not biased in ways that
%				would induce an artificial year-on-dear decline.				
%		\end{itemize}
	\item External data from \href{https://hollywoodpartnership.com/}{\it The Hollywood Partnership} 
		from 19 Feb.\ are consistent with our PIT count in a common tract (1902.02) and an independent

	% (reduced individuals, flat
%		or marginally higher dwelling counts).
%	\item Tracts monitored by \selah\ since May 2020 show similar declines to that implied by our data. 
%		One of these tracts is 1912.01 in East Hollywood, whose 27 Feb.\ \selah\ estimate  agrees with our 
%		PIT value.% in unsheltered homelessness.

% 1907.00 is also interesting in that total population stayed nearly the same but identified
% individuals and dwellings basically swapped: IND 73->38; CVRTM 31->70. This has a big impact
% on people's perceptions, and it's in a very high-traffic part of the community.

%The pro/vol trends are consistent everywhere except tract 1927.00, 
%			where pro counts dropped significantly more for both individuals and dwellings (esp.\ 
%			tents). 1927.00 comprises 22\% of total counts in East Hollywood. Unsheltered 
%			homelessness in that CoC was flat or rose slightly outside of that tract.}
%{\bfr 1927.00 is the tract with the PATH Madison PSH. Phase II opened in Jan 2020---leasing began May 
%2020---and is 120 units, some of which were filled from nearby folks but I dunno how many. LEA recounted 
%this tract 4 March at $\sim$9:00 AM and found 94 total population vs.\ pro's 129. Only place where
%LEA counted more objects was vans. Adding that to the pro total adds 16 people (9 vans).

{\bfr Up to the number of vehicle dwellers in safe parking locations,} the above suggests that our results 
are both quantitatively and qualitatively reliable.\\

\noindent {\bf Comments:} A $\sim$30\% drop in unsheltered individuals in both Hollywood and 
East Hollywood drives the decline we find, for which government initiatives to move people indoors 
(Project Roomkey) and staunch inflow into homelessness (eviction moratoria) may be partially responsible. 
Indeed, \href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4672-2020-homeless-count-council-district-13}{CD13's} share of \href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4585-2020-greater-los-angeles-homeless-count-los-angeles-continuum-of-care-coc-}{LA County's unsheltered senior population} (6.5\%) implies that perhaps 100 of its \href{https://projectroomkeytracker.com/}{1608 occupied rooms} were filled with Greater Hollywood residents on the night 
of the count---about half the inferred change. The opening of at least one 
\href{https://www.lamayor.org/ABridgeHome}{\it A Bridge Home} site in Los Feliz---whose catchment area 
includes Greater Hollywood---and 120 PATH permanent supportive housing units may also have contributed. 
The latter are located in tract 1927.00. While all of those units did not go to local residents, any that did would help
drive that tract's large observed decrease. Coordinated Entry System data will constrain these possibilities.
%1927.00 is actually in the catchment of 3 ABHs that were either new or expanded between PIT counts. 
%Lodi, however, did not fill its new beds, and Lafayette doesn't cover the whole tract, so we won't speculate.
%Nevertheless, technically, even at 50\% decompression, residents of 1927.00 may have been eligible 
%for any of 89 new ABH beds. It's also on the CoC boundary.

{\bfp {\it However}, if there are fewer people on the street, the conditions in which they live have 
degraded markedly. COVID has restricted or eliminated access to restaurant and park bathrooms, libraries (and so 
\href{https://www.lapl.org/homeless-resources/the-source}{\it The Source} service days), DPSS 
(EBT, Medi-Cal), DMV (ID replacement), and DMH facilities. Physical limitations on caseworker 
access to clients at hospitals and clinics has also hindered successful discharges. These qualitative harms are reflected 
by a 25\% increase in 
\href{https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-07/the-powerful-synthetic-opioid-fentanyl-is-behind-rising-deaths-in-the-homeless-population}{overdose deaths} and visually amplified by a doubling of unsheltered dwellings in 13\% of census 
tracts\footnote{\bfp Including 1907.00, Central Hollywood's commercial core.} while 
\href{https://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2020/20-0147_misc_3-17-20_p.pdf}{City} and State sanitation programs 
were simultaneously de-scoped.} So, while the PIT data may support the efficacy of programs designed to reduce street 
homelessness, they do {\it not} suggest that the state of homelessness in Greater Hollywood has improved. In the 
fight to rebuild lives---as well as build homes---that fact {\bfp must remain paramount.}

%
% {\bfr Five ABH's cover Greater Hollywood,
%three have catchment areas covering 1927.00. Their net addition is 33 beds, total, but 89 in that tract (whose
%net gain is eroded by losses of preexisting beds from Schrader and Garnder in the west).}

%DPSS closed; phone system with long waits req'd to replace EBT. If you don't have a phone your stuck.

%Libraries are closed, and therefore {\it The Source} service connection events. 
%Daytime charity resources and some parks are closed, resulting in more exposure to the weather and less food.

%Med-Cal not accessible via DPSS. Enrolling in health insurance requires similar phone calls and that a state 
%ID be uploaded (previously not required). Lacking insurance affects likelihood and length of admission to hospital. 
%Discharges requiring skilled or recuperative care placements are even more difficult.

%DMV is by appointment only and appointments are made online.

%DMH clinic services done via telehealth, leaving homeless clients hanging. One FSP has abandoned all field work due to COVID. 
%Clients in crisis needing evaluations redirected to hospitals.

%Hospitals, IMD's step down facilities and SNF's do not allow visitors, limiting the ability of case managers to negotiate 
%with clients and social workers to ensure successful discharges. Consent forms for sharing info cannot be signed by patients 
%due to lack of access.
%
%Homeless people have gotten sicker while hospitals and LAFD have become overburdened dealing with COVID fallout, 
%resulting in less access to emergency care.

%{\bfr KANAGI: ``we've seen a visual drop; dunno where they went but...'' On 2/18 they found 136 
%total tents in the BID vs our 127 (I haven't vetted the rest of the lines; that's just 12\# hot so w/e). (Also 99
%ppl compared to our 89, and 7 vehicles to our 10 and we weren't tracking those as hard as tents.) 
%On the 5th, they counted 163. That's a 17\% decline in 2 weeks, a little more that what we've seen year on year.
%Suggests maybe something happened in early Feb.? -- 3/2 @ 9:55 AM. The tent+mkshft count in 1902.02 is also 
%right on..}

%Only seven tracts saw significant increases in raw counts, with makeshift dwellings the only category to increase in both CoCs. 

%Cars and vans are hard to count, but there's no evidence of a bias. I repeated the most deviant tract the next day, 
%and another tract the day after that. In the latter case, both of my estimates were 0.5 units off the mean, in the 
%former, vans were at that level and I counted fewer cars. Brian and I also recovered a consistent amount of vehicles 
%with the BID (10 vs. their 6 separated by 20+ days). The rest of the tracts show a mean inter-counter bias of 0.6 
%cars (0.4 std.~err) and 1.24 ($0.76\sigma$) vans across all tracts, which should be accounted for in the MC.

% Pro teams counted areas comprising $\sim$43\% of the total raw counts. Three out of these 4 tracts 
% were counted by Covenant House teams, but 1927.00 has the largest drop of any tract and is Elyse 
% from The Center. That tract is basically responsible for the entire decline in East Hollywood, and most 
% of that is in reduced tents, so we should 	talk to these teams.
