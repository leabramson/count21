\begin{abstract}

Data from February 25, 2021 censuses of Hollywood and East Hollywood shows that 
unsheltered homelessness has fallen in those communities by $11\%\pm9\%$ and 
$15\%\pm12\%$, \resp, compared to the 2020 LAHSA Point-In-Time (PIT) count (90\% CI). 
A 30\% drop in individuals seen on the street drives this change, reducing the number of identified 
persons and dwellings in about a third of census tracts. Unsheltered living is thus likely to have 
quantitatively declined even if the average occupancy of dwellings is updated. Simultaneously, 
however, 28\% of tracts saw at least a doubling of tents and makeshift structures. This trend may 
contribute to qualitative perceptions that the state of homelessness has worsened over the past year, 
which---given COVID-related disruptions to health, hygiene, and social support services---are also 
likely to be accurate. Coordinated Entry System data will reveal whether homelessness in toto has 
declined or merely Greater Hollywood's unsheltered portion.

\end{abstract}

\section{Context}
\label{sec:intro}

The Los Angeles Homelessness Services Authority (LAHSA) conducts an annual Point In Time (PIT) 
census of Los Angeles County's unhoused population. These data inform programmatic funding levels, 
educate residents, undergird legislation, and shape the daily practices of professional and volunteer 
service providers. 

As the official assessment of the scope of one of our most pressing humanitarian issues, the LAHSA Count 
is invaluable. Due to disruptions from COVID-19, however, the unsheltered portion of the 2021 count was 
cancelled. Since 70\% of the City of LA's (``LA's'') unhoused residents were unsheltered in 2020, without 
additional efforts, this cancellation will substantially erode our understanding of homelessness following 
an unprecedented year of economic disruption and government intervention---both of which may have 
significantly affected the number of unhoused Angelenos.

Greater Hollywood is an epicenter of the homelessness crisis. According to the 2020 Count, the 
Hollywood and East Hollywood Communities were home to 2203 unhoused residents, 1714 of whom 
(78\%) were unsheltered. This figure corresponds to roughly 
\href{https://www.lahsa.org/data?id=45-2020-homeless-count-by-community-city}
{5\% of LA's homeless population} in an area with \href{https://geomap.ffiec.gov/FFIECGeocMap/GeocodeMap1.aspx}{3.5\% of its total population}. In some places, 1-in-25 Hollywood residents are 
unhoused compared to 1-in-100 citywide.

While the above statistics are tragic, Hollywood is also home to large and increasingly formalized
coalitions of service providers, business leaders, residents, and governmental entities dedicated to 
humanely housing everyone in their neighborhood. Given the capacity of the above organizations and 
the importance of the annual PIT count in educating residents, funders, and legislators, Hollywood 
proceeded as a collective to conduct an unsponsored grassroots PIT \Count\ on Thursday, 
February 25, 2021.

This document details the methodology and findings of that \Count. 
Section \ref{sec:procedure} describes the volunteer training, data acquisition, 
and analysis protocols. Section \ref{sec:results} presents estimates of the unsheltered 
populations in Hollywood and East Hollywood, contextualizes those in terms of the 2020 
LAHSA PIT results and those communities' total populations, and presents cross-checks. 
Section \ref{sec:discussion} provides interpretation and highlights areas where quantitive findings 
may drive qualitative impressions as to the ``felt'' state of the crisis. Section \ref{sec:summary} 
summarizes. The Appendix provides additional information, including tract-level raw tallies and 
population inferences. All data are available at {\bfr website}.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:procedure}
%
%The \Count\ took place on 25 February 2021 circa at 7.00 PM. This timing corresponds to one month 
%after and four hours before the official event would have occurred. Beyond those choices, our program 
%adhered as closely as possible to the official LAHSA 2020 PIT data collection and analysis protocols. 
%
%The \Count\ was launched from The Center at Blessed Sacrament (``The Center''), a major service 
%provider in Hollywood, at 6636 Selma Ave. All volunteer teams reported and returned to this 
%location as they would to a LAHSA community hub in past years, but, as COVID precautions, 
%training was performed remotely in the week preceding the count and volunteers never left their 
%vehicles.

\subsection{Data Acquisition}
\label{sec:acquisition}

The \Count\ was based out of The Center at Blessed Sacrament (``The Center''), a major service 
provider in Hollywood. All volunteers reported and returned to this location as they would a LAHSA 
community hub in the past. Unlike previous PIT counts, however, training was performed offsite, 
volunteers never left their vehicles, and all surveying occurred before 10:00 PM.

The \Count\ covered the \ntracts\ US Census tracts constituting the LAHSA-defined 
\href{https://www.lahsa.org/data?id=45-2020-homeless-count-by-community-city}{Hollywood 
and East Hollywood Communities} (21 and 18 tracts, \resp). It did not recognize census 
tract ``splits''---e.g., ``1905.10a''---which modified of the definition of Hollywood to include 
all of tract 1905.10 and East Hollywood to include all of tract 1913.01. Since 2016, tract 1905.10b 
has never hosted more than 7 unsheltered people and 1913.01a never more than 15. As such,
these modifications do not significantly affect community-level results.
%Sections \ref{sec:results} and \ref{sec:discussion} discuss community-level results with 
%tract-level tallies provided in the Appendix. Results for Greater Hollywood are not directly comparable 
%to any official service geography but are available upon request. 
Figure \ref{fig:map} shows the \Count\ footprint.

All tracts were vetted by outreach professionals from The Center prior to assignment. Tracts 
deemed especially challenging---e.g., due to their proximity to freeway onramps/peripheries---were 
reserved for professional counting teams. Vetting produced \nprof\ such tracts, which were surveyed 
by personnel from The Center and Covenant House circa 3:00 PM on 25 Feb. The remaining \nvol\ 
tracts were divided among the volunteer vehicle-based teams and surveyed beginning at 7:00 PM. 

With 
the exception of one tract in East Hollywood, teams were restricted to one or the other community, 
making the community-level results nearly independent. Cross-comparisons therefore serve as data 
quality indicators (Section \ref{sec:crossChecks}). Table \ref{tbl:tractStats} records which tracts were 
surveyed by which kind of team. 

Thirty-two volunteer teams participated in the \Count, which was limited to existing ``pods'' of two 
to three people to minimize the possibility of COVID transmission. 
%Singlet volunteers were admitted 
%but remained on-site to assist with traffic control and material distribution. 
All participants wore 
personal protective equipment and maintained social distancing when appropriate.

\end{figure*}

Counting followed 2020 LAHSA PIT protocols to the greatest extent possible. Each volunteer team 
comprised at least a driver and a counter and was assigned two tracts. Three-person teams 
included a navigator, as well. If present, the navigator directed the driver while the counter tallied 
individuals/dwellings. In two-person teams, the counter doubled as the navigator. Training 
emphasized techniques aimed at reducing counters' cognitive loads to minimize errors (e.g., 
covering interior streets in a serpentine pattern before circling the tract border). Teams were 
instructed to count both sides of interior streets but only interior sides of border streets 
as described in the official 2020 PIT training materials.

All teams were deployed by roughly 7:30 PM and returned by 9:55 PM.

Upon arriving at The Center, organizers provided each team a clipboard containing two tract maps,
two tally sheets, and one 1-page training summary with a contact number for field issues.

The tally sheets were the data acquisition tool. These contained separate columns for each of the 
nine categories of unhoused individuals/dwellings recognized in the 2020 LAHSA PIT count: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item adults (ages $\geq$25);
	\item transition age youths (``TAY,'' 18--24);
	\item unaccompanied minors;
	\item families (at least one adult with at least one minor); 
	\item cars;
	\item vans;
	\item RVs;
	\item tents;
	\item makeshift structures.
\end{enumerate}
Dwellings---items (5) to (9)---are treated specially in the analysis and hereafter 
may be referred to as ``CVRTM.'' Adults+TAY may also be combined into 
``Persons'' (P). No families or unaccompanied minors were identified.\footnote{
One potential unaccompanied minor was reported in tract 1912.01 but could not be confirmed by outreach
personnel dispatched to that location. One potential family was also reported dwelling in a van in
tract 1899.05. They could also not be confirmed. The upper limits for these categories (3 each at 95\%
confidence) capture this uncertainty, but their raw counts are set to zero.} See Appendix for examples
of the above documents.

Upon returning, counters verbally read their results to organizers who entered them into a google 
form. Organizers verbally confirmed the counts before submitting the form and recovering the
paper tally sheets.
%Volunteer email addresses were also retained for follow-up. 

Once all materials were collected, organizers cross-checked the electronic records---a
google sheet generated by the form responses---with the paper tallies and identified any 
uncounted areas. None requiring follow-up were found. Disagreements between electronic 
and paper references were corrected to the paper tally. 
%All data are available at {\bfr website}.

Given turnout, every volunteer tract was counted by at least two teams. Four tracts were counted
in triplicate. Beyond increasing the accuracy of the count, repeat measurements enhance our 
understanding of errors (Sections \ref{sec:dupes}) and provide robustness: one tally was 
uninterpretable, leaving only the result from the second team.

All told, the data comprise 37 pair-wise volunteer measurements,
%---29 duplicates + 
%4 triplicates (=8 additional pairs)---
one unique volunteer measurement, and nine unique 
professional assessments. The latter account for $\sim$20\% of tracts in both communities and roughly 
40\% of identified individuals and dwellings. Year-on-year trends are consistent between
volunteer- and professional-counted tracts (Section \ref{sec:crossChecks}). 
%The largest increase was observed by volunteers, the largest
%decrease by professionals.%; both tracts are located in E.~Hollywood.

\subsubsection{Volunteer Training}
\label{sec:training}

Teams underwent mandatory, $\sim$30 minute Zoom-based training sessions before arriving 
for the \Count. Each participant was also required to watch the official 2020 LAHSA PIT training 
video.% and sign participation waivers.

The training covered the motivation for the \Count, an overview of the survey geography, team roles, 
and examples of unhoused dwellings. Except for people standing next to tents---as described 
in the 2020 LAHSA video---volunteers were instructed to count CVRTM and individuals separately 
and not to try to estimate how many people might live in or be associated with a specific dwelling. 
This ensured that results could be analyzed as a function of the CVRTM weights, which may change 
with future information.% (see Section \ref{sec:analysis}).

The training primed volunteers only with min/max estimates of tract-level individual+dwelling 
counts (``0--120'') and the likelihood of encountering unaccompanied minors or families (``very unlikely'')
or TAY (``some tracts, especially in Hollywood''). These statements were informed by the 2020 
LAHSA PIT results. No other prior was established. The training presentation is available 
at: \url{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xFrtU26yjPuiUv9KHZ3Uj2_sAoT1ClGo/view?usp=sharing}.

\subsection{Data Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

The data form a $9\times73$ array containing each team's tract-level tallies for each unhoused 
individual/dwelling class. The population inference entails averaging duplicate tract counts and 
weighting CVRTM by their mean occupancies. We produce 10,000 realizations of this inference 
incorporating random perturbations of the counts and weights based on their 
errors (see below). The final product is a $9\times10000\times39$ array that may be split and 
summed to provide aggregate, tract, or category-level population estimates and uncertainties.

Our baseline result assumes the 
\href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4635-usc-2018-2020-multipliers-and-estimates-overview.pdf}
{2020 SPA-4/CD13 CVRTM weights} underpinning the 2020 LAHSA 
\href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4686-2020-greater-los-angeles-city-community-homelessness-report-service-planning-area-4.pdf}{Community Summaries}. We recognize that these weights may have changed since they were last
estimated. We cannot reassess all of them and encourage robust efforts to do so. However, at 
least one survey of tent-dwellers in Hollywood suggests the tent weight has not changed 
significantly. We analyze the impact of adopting three other reasonable CVRTM choices in 
Section \ref{sec:comp} (Table \ref{tbl:weights}), but they do not significantly affect our findings.
%COVID-related activities such as tent  distribution efforts may have changed

%While an estimate of the underlying population, uncertainties in each visual count and weight 
%must be accounted for to understand how confident one can be that that estimate corresponds to
%the truth. We accomplish this by using Monte Carlo integration to construct the full probability
%distribution functions (PDFs) for the number of unsheltered people of each class in each tract.

% {\it These results will
%correspond to the most likely values for the respective quantities in any geography.} However,
%three uncertainties---one small and two large---complicate the interpretation of those sums. 
%We discuss these in Section \ref{sec:discussion}, but account for them as best we can using 
%Monte Carlo techniques to construct the full underlying probability distribution functions (PDFs) 
%for each class in each tract.
%
%All results discussed below derive from 10,000 Monte Carlo realizations of Item (5), above.
%

\subsubsection{Monte Carlo Population Inferences}
\label{sec:mc}

We wish to infer the true unsheltered population in Hollywood and East Hollywood as of 25 February. 
We do so by constructing probability density functions (PDFs) describing the likelihood of encountering 
a given number of unsheltered people in those communities as constrained by our PIT \Count. 
To accomplish this, we model three known uncertainties: (1) errors in the visual tallies, (2) deviations 
of the CVRTM weights from their quoted means, and (3) the intrinsic background rate of persons/dwellings
in areas in which none were actually sighted. Items (1) and (3) reflect how our PIT tally might change
if performed at a different time or by different teams. Item (2) reflects how the mean 
occupancy of CVRTM in our survey area might differ from that in the geography in which the weights 
were defined.

We model count and weight errors as independent random draws from Gaussian distributions with 
standard deviations of $\sqrt{n}$ and $\sigma$, \resp, where $n$ is the raw PIT tally and 
$\sigma$ is the standard error on the respective CVRTM weight, $w$. 
The $i$-th estimate of the true number, $N$, of people in the $j$-th unsheltered class in any 
tract is then: 
\begin{multline}\label{eq:monte}
	N_{i,j} = \left[n_{j} + \mathcal{G}_{i}(0,\sqrt{n_{j}})\right]\times\max[\mathcal{G}_{i}(w_{j}, \sigma_{j}),1],
\end{multline}
where $\mathcal{G}(\mu,\Sigma)$ is a Gaussian random number with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation 
$\Sigma$. If more than one team counted a tract, $n$ is replaced by the average of their tallies 
and the attendant counting error is divided by the square root of the number of teams. If no members
of the $j$-th unsheltered category were observed, $\sqrt{n_{j}}$ is replaced in the first term 
by that category's estimated background rate, $\sigma_{j}^{\rm bkg}$, discussed in the next section.% \ref{sec:nulls}).

The final output PDFs reflect 10,000 realizations of Equation \ref{eq:monte}. Weights for 
adults and TAY are fixed to unity---$(w,\sigma)\equiv(1,0)$---such that uncertainties reflect only 
counting errors. 

%One potential family and one potential unaccompanied minor were reported, 
%but not confirmed. We therefore set those entires to zero and infer only upper limits.

We place a floor on the CVRTM mean occupancies at 1 person per dwelling; i.e., we assume that the 
{\it mean} person does not own more than one dwelling. This is not to say no one may own more than 
one, just that such a statement is never representative. This choice induces a mild asymmetry in our 
global PDFs but does not significantly affect inferences.
%letting the mean occupancies reach 0 moves the baseline result down by 40 ppl over all of grtr Hwood.
%it's 0.4 sigma or in the IQR.

Often, no persons or dwellings of a specific category are observed in a given tract. Due to shot 
noise, these data are consistent with non-zero values for the true population. The Monte Carlo 
PDF reconstruction allows all such entries to fluctuate based on an assumed background rate,
$\sigma_{j}^{\rm bkg}$.

\subsubsection{Null Entries and Background Rates}
\label{sec:nulls}

Ideally, $\sigma_{j}^{\rm bkg}$ would derive from category variations in similar tracts defined 
by independent criteria. Sufficient data may exist to support that exercise, but it is beyond the scope 
of this analysis. Instead, we adopt a noise floor based on the counts expected if all members of a given 
category were distributed evenly across tracts:
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_{j}^{\rm bkg} \equiv \sqrt{\frac{1}{39}\sum_{\rm tracts}n_{j}}.
\end{equation}

While oversimplistic (Section \ref{sec:concentration}), this method works for any category
for which at least one individual/dwelling was observed in any tract. However, for categories for 
which this is not the case---unaccompanied minors and families, in our case---we set 
$\sigma_{j}^{\rm bkg}$ to the lowest non-zero value of the other categories (corresponding to 
TAY). The adopted backgrounds are thus: 
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_{j}^{\rm bkg}=\{3.2, 0.4, 0.4, 0.9, 1.3, 1.1, 2.8, 2.5, 0.4\}
\end{equation}
adults, TAY, unaccompanied minors, cars, vans, RVs, tents, makeshifts, and families per tract. 

Note that the above numbers are not added to null entries, but random draws from normal distributions
of that width. This treatment is somewhat arbitrary, but we employ it symmetrically---per-tract category 
inferences can be negative---so it does not bias the final estimate. Instead, it sets the upper limits of 
intrinsically rare categories and inflates aggregate uncertainties.

\subsection{Duplicate Counts}
\label{sec:dupes}

Each volunteer tract in both communities (30) were assigned to at least two independent counting teams.
Four tracts additionally received a third pass. Pass 1 paired tracts by tract number. Pass 2 paired projected 
high-population tracts with one that was geographically nearby. Pass 3 was the same as Pass 1 with 
pairings presented in reverse order, such that teams deployed simultaneously would likely start in different 
tracts. 

Results for one of the two teams assigned to tract 1925.20 could not be interpreted, making it the only
volunteer tract with one population estimate.

Figure \ref{fig:dupeChar} shows intercounter comparisons of raw counts (people+dwellings)
at the tract and category levels. Average offsets are close to Poisson expectations in all cases 
except for the highest occupancy tracts, where they are inflated by an outlier (see below).
Explicitly, $\langle\sqrt{(\nu_{1}-\nu_{2})^{2}/(\nu_{1} + \nu_{2})}\rangle=1.4$, where
$\nu$ is the total number of dwellings and people in a given tract returned by one of the teams. 
In the one instance where no persons or dwellings of any kind were identified (tract 1899.03), 
both teams agreed exactly.

The outlier is tract 1901.00, whose repeat measurements differ by $6.6\,\sigma$. There, 
one team counted $\{P,C,V,R,T,M\}=\{23,1,1,1,6,2\}$ while the other counted $\{77,15,10,1,6,6\}$. 
Abramson re-counted this tract on-foot 14 hours after the PIT tally, obtaining $\{36, 4, 6, 0, 8, 2\}$.
In total, this tally ($\nu_{\rm Abramson}=56\pm7$) is within $1.9\,\sigma$ of the volunteers' mean 
($\langle\nu_{\rm PIT}\rangle=75\pm6$). As such, we retain the volunteer PIT estimate as-is. As illustrated in 
Figure \ref{fig:dupeChar}, top, the mean intercounter dispersion drops to $1.3\,\sigma$ if this tract is 
excluded.

In terms of categories, all dispersions are consistent with Poisson expectations except for RVs, where 
agreement is significantly better. Given their salience, this finding is reassuring if unsurprising.

%1901.00 inter-counter difference is 4.7 sigma (sqrt(delta) / root(n1 + n2) / root(2))

%\begin{itemize}
%%	\item All vol tracts counted at least twice;

%\end{itemize}

No team counted tracts in both Hollywood and East Hollywood. As such, the volunteer counts
in those communities represent independent datasets. Including the professional-counted tracts, 
cross-talk comes from one tract in East Hollywood counted by a team that surveyed five 
tracts in Hollywood. We discuss intercommunity comparisons between volunteer and 
professionally counted tracts in Section \ref{sec:crossChecks}.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

This section presents community- and aggregate-level estimates for the number of unsheltered people 
living in Hollywood and East Hollywood as of 25 February 2021. Sections \ref{sec:hWood} and \ref{sec:eHo} 
summarize our results, \ref{sec:comp} compares them to the 2020 LAHSA PIT estimates, 
\ref{sec:concentration} quantifies the population's geographic distribution, and \ref{sec:crossChecks}
presents cross-checks.

%Section \ref{sec:discussion} describes how 
%varying elements of Section \ref{sec:mc}'s analysis modulates these results.

\subsection{Hollywood}
\label{sec:hWood}

Counters identified $702\pm44$ (95\% CI) persons and dwellings in the 21 census tracts 
comprising the Hollywood Community. Modulated by the baseline CVRTM weights, these 
estimates imply a total unsheltered population of $936\pm92$ people 
(90\% CI; Figure \ref{fig:communityPDFs}, left), with the plurality (35\%) living in tents 
(Table \ref{tbl:summary}; Figure \ref{fig:rawCounts}, left). The five tracts counted by professional 
teams---largely along the US 101 corridor---comprised 42\% of raw counts and 43\% of inferred 
unsheltered people. Tract 1910.00 (pro-counted) had the most people and dwellings ($123\rightarrow170$
total population); 1899.03 had the fewest ($0\rightarrow$$<$12 total population). %These tracts also bracket the population statistics.

\href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4693-2020-greater-los-angeles-homeless-count-cvrtm-conversion-factors}
{SPA4-wide} values lowers Hollywood's inferred total unsheltered population to $912\pm68$ people; applying
an updated tent weight based on a survey in Hollywood raises it to $944\pm118$ people (Section
\ref{sec:discussion}). Neither shift is significant.

\subsection{East Hollywood}
\label{sec:eHo}

Counters identified $389\pm33$ (95\% CI) persons and dwellings in the 18 census tracts 
comprising East Hollywood. Modulated by the baseline CVRTM weights, these estimates imply 
a total unsheltered population of $556\pm83$ people (Figure \ref{fig:communityPDFs},
right), with the plurality (39\%) living in makeshift structures (Table \ref{tbl:summary}, 
Figure \ref{fig:rawCounts}, right). The four tracts counted by professional teams comprised 46\% of 
those counts and 47\% of inferred unsheltered people. Tract 1927.00 (pro-counted) had the 
most people and dwellings ($87\rightarrow129$ total population); 1912.04 had the fewest 
($5\rightarrow$$<$16 total population). 
%These tracts also bracket the total population statistics. 
%The plurality of counts were of makeshift structures---statistically 
%consistent with the number of persons identified on the street---followed by tents 
%(Figure \ref{fig:rawCounts}, right).

Modifying the CVRTM weights from the baseline SPA4/CD13 values to the SPA4 wide values 
lowers East Hollywood's inferred total unsheltered population to $539\pm59$ people; applying
the updated tent weight raises it to $559\pm87$ people. Neither shift is significant.

\subsection{Comparison to 2020}
\label{sec:comp}

The official LAHSA estimates from the 2020 PIT count are overplotted in Figure \ref{fig:communityPDFs} 
as red vertical lines in each panel: 1058 unsheltered people in Hollywood, 656 in East Hollywood.
Our baseline inferences suggest a $>$95\% probability that the current population has fallen from 
those levels. Using the PDFs' medians and 90\% CIs, we infer declines of $11\%\pm9\%$ and 
$15\%\pm12\%$, \resp. 

Figure \ref{fig:tractYrYr} shows the changes in counts and inferred population in each tract 
as geographically illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:map}. We find significant gains in 7 tracts and significant 
declines in 14, resulting in net changes of $-192\pm45$ and $-210\pm76$ counts or people, \resp.\footnote{Tract-level 
CVRTM counts inferred from \href{https://www.lahsa.org/data?id=45-2020-homeless-count-by-community-city}
{LAHSA's data portal}.} The tracts with the largest year-on-year gain (1912.01, $+40$ people) and loss (1927.00, 
$-125$ people) are both in East Hollywood, containing Barnsdall Park and US 101, \resp. Tract 1927.00 is
perhaps entirely responsible for East Hollywood's total inferred population decline. If that tract
is excluded, we estimate $427\pm61$ unsheltered people vs.~2020's estimate of 407. Section 
\ref{sec:discussion} explores this statement further.
%368.808      426.952      491.580
%We speculate as to why these 
%tracts, specifically, saw such changes in Section \ref{sec:discussion}, along with why counts of rough
%saw particularly large declines.

Given the deficit in raw counts, it seems unlikely that reasonable modifications to the CVRTM weights 
will qualitatively change our inferences. Due to the high proportion of people living in tents and makeshifts,
the $w_{T}$ and $w_{M}$ weights are the largest potential error sources. To constrain their evolution
from last year, \href{https://selahnhc.org}{SELAH} outreach teams surveyed 47 tents (38 responses) 
in Hollywood on 28 Feb. This exercise yielded a mean occupancy of $w_{T}=1.39\pm0.14$ people per tent, 
or $w_{T}=1.50\pm0.22$ when non-responses are modeled.\footnote{Assuming they were equally likely to have 
0--4 occupants, each.} While neither the full 2021 PIT area nor $w_{M}$ has been assessed,
%\footnote{$w_{M}=1.75\pm0.66$ was estimated using four makeshifts on 14 March but the sample size precludes.} 
the above values are consistent with the 2020 estimate of $w_{T}=1.48\pm0.11$. 

Figure \ref{fig:wtComp} illustrates the effect of the above CVRTM modifications. All cases imply at 
least a 93\% chance of decline compared to 2020.

We encourage robust efforts to update the CVRTM weights, but the changes required to null the decline we find
are substantial. Only updates to $w_{T}$ and $w_{M}$ can reasonably achieve it. These must rise to 2.2 and 
2.6 people from 1.5 and 1.7 people, \resp, in 2020. Not withstanding the above survey, such $\sim$50\% increases 
in {\it mean} occupancies seem unlikely, especially as known COVID-related tent distribution efforts have pushed 
in the opposite direction (Section \ref{sec:discussion}). While 2021 is unprecedented in many ways, no SPA4/CD13 
CVRTM weight has changed by more than $\sim$30\% year-on-year since 2018.\footnote{Between 2019 and 2020, 
$w_{R}$ fell from $\sim$2 to $\sim$1.4.}

All of the above is largely a reflection of the fact that persons seen on the street fell by $\sim$30\%
(Figure \ref{fig:rawCounts}). Cars and vans are also down from last year by more than the number of 
safe parking spaces (Section \ref{sec:crossChecks}), with only makeshift structures showing a potential 
common gain. All told, the total number of dwellings remained essentially flat. Although uncertainties 
in East Hollywood and effects from tract 1927.00 are large, Figure \ref{fig:proVolComp} reveals the above 
trends to be common across communities and areas counted by volunteers or professionals. Such consistencies 
in nearly independent datasets suggest the results are robust. Section \ref{sec:crossChecks} presents further 
checks.

\subsection{Geographic Concentration}
\label{sec:concentration}

Everyday experience (and Figure \ref{fig:map}) confirms that unsheltered homelessness is
unevenly distributed. This statement is worth quantifying so that arguments over, e.g., the 
placement of new housing facilities may be grounded in data. Figure \ref{fig:gini} is one attempt to 
do so. 

Combining our PIT \Count\ with 2020 \href{https://geomap.ffiec.gov/FFIECGeocMap/GeocodeMap1.aspx}
{US Census} data, we compare the distribution of unsheltered Angelenos vs.\ all Angelenos in Greater
Hollywood. The top panel shows the proportion of people in a given tract that are unsheltered. This fraction 
spans $\sim$0\% to over 4\%, with a mean near 1\%---40\% higher than 
\href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4680-2020-greater-los-angeles-homeless-count-city-of-los-angeles}
{LA's global unsheltered fraction} in Jan.~2020.

The bottom panel shows the cumulative contribution of each tract to Greater Hollywood's
total and unsheltered populations. If people were equitably distributed, the curves would 
form a diagonal line of unit slope, yielding a Gini coefficient $c_{\rm Gini}=0$. 
The total population in Greater Hollywood has $c_{\rm Gini}\simeq0.1$---50\% of people 
living 40\% of tracts---close to evenly distributed. The unsheltered population, 
on the other hand, has $c_{\rm Gini}=0.44\pm0.02$---50\% of people living in 20\% of 
tracts---analogous to those describing income inequality in 
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality#UN,_World_Bank_and_CIA_list_\%E2\%80\%93_income_ratios_and_Gini_indices}{Rwanda, Philippines, or Malawi}. Such a concentration 
of lived trauma, real poverty, and the attendant externalities of unsheltered homelessness 
should condition equity-driven policymaking.

\subsection{Cross-checks}
\label{sec:crossChecks}

Multiple cross-checks involving independent counters and external datasets suggest 
that the raw counts from our 2021 PIT \Count\ are accurate. The validating data are also
available at {\bfr website}.

\subsubsection{Internal checks}

Figure \ref{fig:dupeChar}'s comparisons of the count's 37 duplicate tract measurements suggest 
per-tract and -category counting uncertainties are consistent with the random errors built into the analysis. 
There is thus no strong evidence that counters were biased in identifying unsheltered persons or dwellings. 
Of course, the data do not preclude systematic inefficiencies in identifying, e.g., cars and 
vans---which can be difficult at night---but Figure \ref{fig:proVolComp} illustrates that, at least across all
dwellings, volunteers and professionals saw consistent trends. As the professional tracts were surveyed 
on foot and in daylight, such consistency suggests that biases are not large. Post-facto independent 
measurements of key geographies suggest this, too.

\subsubsection{External checks}

Three census tracts were re-surveyed in detail, none of which yield evidence of a PIT undercount:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Tract 1901.00 -- intercounter variability outlier. Abramson
		  assessed this tract 14 hours after the PIT count (circa 9:00 AM) with results 
		  $1.9\,\sigma$ lower than the volunteers' average (Section \ref{sec:dupes}).
	\item Tract 1912.01 -- largest increase. Abramson assessed this tract on 
		27 Feb.\ circa 12:00 PM as part of a SELAH monitoring campaign. Results were consistent with 
		the PIT \Count\ to within $1\,\sigma$: $\{P,C,V,R,T,M\}_{\rm PIT}=\{18.5,0.5, 3.5, 1.5, 5.5, 12.0\}$ 
		vs.~$\{21,0,4,1,8,6\}$.
	\item Tract 1927.00 -- largest decrease. Abramson assessed this tract
		on 4 March circa 8:30 AM by vehicle with results lower than the PIT's assessment by 35 inferred 
		people, though 9 additional vans. Given this tract's density and configuration---home to 
		many freeway ramps and shoulders---it was originally surveyed on foot by outreach professionals. 
		As such, we take Abramson's vehicular recount to suggests only that the PIT data are not biased so 
		as to induce an artificial decline of more than approximately $9\,w_{V}\simeq 16$ people.
\end{itemize}

Two larger-geography surveys concur:% quantitatively and qualitatively:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Biweekly data from \href{https://hollywoodpartnership.com/}{\it The Hollywood Partnership} 
		from 19 Feb.\ are consistent with PIT counts in a common tract (1902.02) and with an independent 
		recount of the entire Business Improvement District performed 28 Feb.\ by Abramson and 
		Kohan. These data also imply a decline from past values.
	\item Three additional tracts in Echo Park and Silver Lake monitored biweekly by SELAH since May 2020 
		also show similar declines.
%		\footnote{Tract 1912.01 is also monitored by SELAH. Its
%		recount was conducted as part of that effort.} 
\end{itemize}
%
%A 27 Feb.\ recount of tract 1912.01 in East Hollywood conducted as as part of a
%		\href{https://selahnch.org}{SELAH} monitoring campaign agrees with our PIT value.% in unsheltered homelessness.
%

Finally, there are 49 safe parking spaces in or near the survey area.\footnote{Per CD13 field deputy. 
 Includes Echo Park. Safe parking providers did not respond to an email query.} 
If occupied on 25 Feb., these locations probably went uncounted. Adding the implied $80\pm16$ total car 
and van dwellers to our results (equal mix) reduces the baseline chance of a decline in unsheltered 
people from 98\% to 92\%. 
%it  account for roughly half of the car+van deficit we see vs.~2020.

All of the above suggests that our results are reliable.
%Assumes equal mix of cars + vans.
%From Starkey: Hwood = 25, Eho = 10, EchoPk = 14; total = 49; total CD13 = 59 but I think it's reasonable

% 1907.00 is also interesting in that total population stayed nearly the same but identified

The upshot of the above is that, as far as we can assess, the number of people experiencing unsheltered
homelessness in Greater Hollywood has declined to levels slightly above those in 2019.\footnote{917, 491 
people in Hollywood and E.~Hollywood, \resp.} A number of factors may contribute to this change, some 
COVID-related and some not.

\subsection{Government Initiatives}

Foremost among these are government programs aimed at moving people indoors and stanching inflow into 
homelessness. The two most salient are COVID-related: Project Roomkey and eviction moratoria.
%Note that Coordinate Entry System (CES) data will constrain all of the following scenarios.

\subsubsection{Eviction Moratoria}

We have no data on how many people the moratoria have prevented from becoming homeless. However,
per the LAHSA Count report, nearly 83,000 people became unhoused in 2020 from LA County's pool 
of over half a million rent-burdened residents. Of these, $\sim$7500 could not be rehoused. Thus, if the eviction
moratoria reduced even 10\% of last year's inflow, extant mechanisms may have had the capacity to place 
everyone under a roof.

\subsubsection{Project Roomkey}

More information is accessible regarding Project Roomkey (PRK). Also according to the 2020 Count report, 
over 6000 unsheltered LA County residents became sheltered at some point between March and May of that year.
Examining only \href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4672-2020-homeless-count-council-district-13}
{CD13's} share of \href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4585-2020-greater-los-angeles-homeless-count-los-angeles-continuum-of-care-coc-}{LA County's unsheltered senior population} (6.5\%), perhaps 100 of PRk's 
\href{https://projectroomkeytracker.com/}{1608 occupied rooms} were filled with Greater Hollywood residents 
on the night of 25 Feb. If so, this would account for about half the inferred global reduction. 

Data from the Coordinated Entry System (CES) will constrain this scenario.

\subsubsection{A Bridge Home}

Unrelated to COVID, at least one \href{https://www.lamayor.org/ABridgeHome}{\it A Bridge Home} (ABH) site 
opened in Los Feliz between this year's and last year's PIT estimate whose catchment area spans nearly all of Greater 
Hollywood. Assuming 50\% capacity due to COVID precautions, this site can account for a further 50 people 
exiting the unsheltered population.

However, COVID-related ``decompression'' of congregate living sites simultaneously reduces available beds in extant
shelters. Assuming 50\% reductions, we estimate that the five ABHs \href{https://arcg.is/0fy81}
{whose catchments touch Greater Hollywood}---Schrader, YWCA/Lodi (recently expanded), Gardner, Riverside, and 
Lafayette---constitute a net addition of just 33 beds (398 total, 116 gained, 83 lost to decompression). 

Local contributions can be substantially larger, however. Tract 1927.00---which saw the largest year-on-year 
decline---overlaps with three ABHs, two of them new. As many as 89 beds may therefore have come online to service 
that tract's unsheltered residents. This corresponds to $\sim$70\% of the population change without considering any 
contributions from a new PATH permanent supportive housing site (see below).

CES data will constrain this scenario.

\subsubsection{Permanent Supportive Housing}

Finally, the leasing of 120 new permanent supportive housing (PSH) units at a PATH site located in tract 1927.00 
may also have contributed. We do not know how many of its rooms went to Greater Hollywood residents, or residents
of that tract. Any that did, however, would help drive the declines we observe in both.

CES data will constrain this scenario.

\subsection{Other Losses}

\subsubsection{Geographic Leakage/Edge Effects}

Our PIT \Count\ could only cover a limited geography. As such, an obvious potential source
of population loss is people exiting Greater Hollywood to nearby communities. In border tracts, this would entail simply
crossing the street. Tract 1927.00 is, again, special in this regard as two of its edges are borders and there is a substantial 
community of unsheltered Angelenos opposite its eastern flank. 

We cannot exclude the possibility that residents simply left, but upcoming grassroots PIT counts in Mid City and Silver 
Lake---which bound Greater Hollywood to the southwest and east, \resp---may provide insights.

\subsubsection{Deaths}

An unfortunate but inevitable source of population loss is death. While people experiencing homelessness are far more 
likely to die from COVID than housed people, \href{http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/docs/SummaryReport_People_Experiencing_Homelessness.pdf}
{Dept.\ of Public Health statistics} suggest that $\sim$200 unhoused LA County residents had succumbed to the 
disease by the time of the PIT count, subordinating its impact to other causes.

Instead, \href{http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/chie/reports/HomelessMortality2020_CHIEBrief_Final.pdf}{drug overdoses},
particularly from methamphetamine, are likely to dominate. Based on data spanning only the first seven months of 2020, overdoses had
killed 929 people experiencing homelessness---a rate 7.6$\times$ higher than COVID to that point.

All told, deaths of people experiencing homelessness increased by 26\% from January through July, 2020, over the same
interval in 2019. A more rigorous analysis is needed to determine the extent to which these statistics contributed 
qualitatively to the decline we infer, but, quantitatively, they must.

\subsection{Objective Support for Subjective Trends}

The authors of this report did not expect to discover a decline in Greater Hollywood's unsheltered population.
The feeling we accumulated over the course of 2020 was one of a meaningful, if not dramatic worsening in the
state of homelessness. The PIT data provide hints as to how these subjective and objective conclusions may be
reconciled.

Principally, smaller scales tell different stories than the community level results. Eleven tracts---28\%---saw at 
least a doubling in their number of tent and makeshift structures, with a mean increase of over 10 such dwellings
per tract.\footnote{Tracts 1899.04, 1902.02, 1907.00, 1911.20, 1912.01, 1913.01, 1913.02, 1914.10, 1915.00,
1916.10, 1917.20.} As such, the {\it visual salience} of unsheltered living increased in many places. Such 
quantitative growth was qualitatively amplified by LAPD's suspension of LAMC 56.11 enforcement during COVID. 
Ordinarily, this law requires tents to be collapsed during the day. Without it, the impression of homelessness might 
increase even in areas where the number of tents {\it declined} since those that exist would have been newly salient.
The effect in places where the numbers doubled is obvious, and tracts 1907.00 and 1912.01 are two such places.
%Six tracts saw at least a 
%50\% increase in the number of dwellings. Of these, four saw more than 100\% gains.\footnote{Tracts 1902.02, 
%1907.00, 1912.01, 1915.00, accounting for nearly 9\% of all street dwellings and 16\% of all counts.} % 1925.20

Tract 1907.00 is located in the heart of Central Hollywood's commercial district,\footnote{It spans Fountain Ave to 
Sunset Blvd to Franklin Ave, Vine St to Highland Ave to La Brea Ave.}.  It is one of four tracts wherein the number
of dwellings and persons swapped in rank order compared to 2020. Indeed, the swap was so precise in 1907.00
as to nearly conserve the total number of identified people+dwellings (Figure \ref{fig:1907}). This phenomenon would 
increase the {\it visual salience} of unsheltered living even as the population as a whole remained unchanged.

Meanwhile, tract 1912.01's population did {\it not} remain the same, but more than tripled, leading to the largest 
overall gain vs.~2020. This tract contains the western edge of Vermont Ave between Fountain Ave and Hollywood
Blvd, and the southern edge of Hollywood Blvd between Vermont and Normandie (Barnsdall Park). Both are
are high-traffic corridors and so areas of enhanced visibility. 

The above local trends provide some support for the impact of COVID-related tent distribution efforts by professional
and volunteer service providers, which, anecdotally, have been reported as robust. Interestingly, the global 
number of tents remained similar to that from 2020. As such, it seems a concentration of tents in the above
tracts combined with a substantial number going to replacing damaged or destroyed tents soaked up this
source.

{\bfr need to forefront geographic concentration of tents and the global impact of 1927.00 somewhere}

%Ancillary data from regularly monitored census tracts suggests that the date offset is unlikely to substantially 
%erode comparability between this and past datasets. Limited daytime recounts also suggest that 
%time-of-day effects are sub-dominant.

%1927.00 is actually in the catchment of 3 ABHs that were either new or expanded between PIT counts. 
%Lodi, however, did not fill its new beds, and Lafayette doesn't cover the whole tract, so we won't speculate.
%Nevertheless, technically, even at 50\% decompression, residents of 1927.00 may have been eligible 
%for any of 89 new ABH beds. It's also on the CoC boundary.

\subsection{Quality of Life Degradation}

To say nothing of the implications of our findings for the unsheltered population 
\href{https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-12/new-report-foresees-tens-of-thousands-losing-homes-by-2023}
{after the eviction moratoria lapse}, if there are fewer people on the street today, their quality of life has degraded markedly. 
COVID has restricted or eliminated access to restaurant and park bathrooms, libraries (and so 
\href{https://www.lapl.org/homeless-resources/the-source}{\it The Source} service days), Dept.~of Public Social Services 
(EBT, Medi-Cal), Dept.~of Motor Vehicles (ID replacement), and Dept.~of Mental Health facilities. Physical limitations 
on client access at hospitals and clinics has also hindered caseworkers from managing successful discharges. These 
qualitative harms are reflected by the aforementioned 25\% increase in \href{https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-07/the-powerful-synthetic-opioid-fentanyl-is-behind-rising-deaths-in-the-homeless-population}{overdose deaths}, and
amplified by the simultaneous \href{https://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2020/20-0147_misc_3-17-20_p.pdf}
{suspension or de-scoping} of city and state sanitation programs (which would also increase the visual impact of
the doubling of tents in 13\% of census tracts). 

As such, while our 2021 PIT data may support the efficacy of programs designed to reduce street 
homelessness, they do {\it not} suggest that the state of homelessness in Greater Hollywood has improved. 
In the fight to rebuild lives---as well as build homes---that fact must remain paramount.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

Data from February 25, 2021 censuses of Hollywood and East Hollywood shows that 
unsheltered homelessness has fallen in those communities by $11\%\pm9\%$ and 
$15\%\pm12\%$, \resp, compared to the 2020 LAHSA Point-In-Time (PIT) count (90\% CI). 
A 30\% drop in individuals seen on the street drives this change, reducing the number of identified 
persons and dwellings in about a third of census tracts. Unsheltered living is thus likely to have 
declined quantitatively even if the average occupancy of, e.g., tents is updated. Simultaneously, 
however, 13\% of tracts saw at least a doubling in street dwellings. This trend may contribute to 
qualitative perceptions that the state of homelessness has worsened over the past year, which---given 
COVID-related reductions in health, hygiene, and social support services---are also likely to be accurate.
Coordinated Entry System data will reveal whether homelessness has declined in toto or if 
government initiatives reduced only the portion of people living unsheltered in Greater Hollywood.
