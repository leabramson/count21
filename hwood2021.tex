\begin{abstract}

Data from February 25, 2021 censuses of Hollywood and East Hollywood shows that 
unsheltered homelessness has fallen in those communities by $11\%\pm9\%$ and 
$15\%\pm12\%$, \resp, compared to the 2020 LAHSA Point-In-Time (PIT) count (90\% CI). 
A 30\% drop in individuals seen on the street drives this change, reducing the number of identified 
persons and dwellings in about a third of census tracts. Unsheltered living is thus likely to have 
declined quantitatively even if the average occupancy of, e.g., tents is updated. Simultaneously, 
however, 13\% of tracts saw at least a doubling in street dwellings. This trend may contribute to 
qualitative perceptions that the state of homelessness has worsened over the past year, which---given 
COVID-related reductions in health, hygiene, and social support services---are also likely to be accurate.
Coordinated Entry System data will reveal whether homelessness has declined in toto or if 
government initiatives reduced only the portion of people living unsheltered in Greater Hollywood.

\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The Los Angeles Homelessness Services Authority (LAHSA) typically conducts a Point In Time (PIT) 
census of the unhoused population of Los Angeles County annually. These data inform programmatic
funding levels, educate residents, undergird local and state legislative efforts, and shape the day-to-day 
practices of professional and volunteer service providers. 

As the official assessment of the scope of one of the most pressing humanitarian issues of our time, 
the LAHSA Count is invaluable. However, due to disruptions from COVID-19, the unsheltered portion 
of the 2021 PIT count was cancelled. Given that 70\% of LA's unhoused residents were unsheltered in 
2020, this move means that---absent additional efforts---our understanding of the state of homelessness 
following a year of unprecedented economic disruptions and governmental interventions will be 
substantially incomplete.

Greater Hollywood is an epicenter of the homelessness crisis. According to the 2020 Count, the 
Hollywood and East Hollywood Communities were home to 2203 unhoused residents, 1714 of whom 
(78\%) were unsheltered. This figure corresponds to roughly 
\href{https://www.lahsa.org/data?id=45-2020-homeless-count-by-community-city}
{5\% of LA's homeless population} concentrated in an area with 
\href{https://geomap.ffiec.gov/FFIECGeocMap/GeocodeMap1.aspx}{3.5\% of its total population}. 
In some regions in those communities, 1-in-25 residents are unhoused compared to 1-in-100 
citywide.

			and south respectively by Franklin	and Melrose Aves, with East Hollywood

\end{figure*}

While the above statistics are tragic, Hollywood is also marked by large and increasingly formalized
coalitions of service providers, business leaders, residents, and quasi-governmental entities dedicated to 
humanely ending homelessness in their community. Given the capacity of the above organizations and 
individuals, and given the importance of the annual PIT count in educating local residents, funders, and
legislators--the Hollywood community decided to proceed with an unsponsored grassroots PIT \Count\
in 2021.

This document describes the methodology and findings of that \Count, which took place on Thursday, 
February 25, 2021. Section \ref{sec:procedure} describes data acquisition, analysis, and volunteer
training protocols. Section \ref{sec:results} presents estimates of the unsheltered 
populations in the Hollywood and East Hollywood Communities and contextualizes those findings in 
terms of the 2020 LAHSA results. Section \ref{sec:discussion} describes cross-checks on those
results, highlights areas for further study, and reveals where our quantitive findings may drive 
qualitative impressions among residents and professionals alike. Section \ref{sec:summary} 
summarizes. Additional information can be found in the Appendix, including a table of tract-level 
results in each of the survey's 39 US Census tracts. All data are made publicly available at 
{\bfr website}.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:procedure}
%
%The \Count\ took place on 25 February 2021 circa at 7.00 PM. This timing corresponds to one month 
%after and four hours before the official event would have occurred. Beyond those choices, our program 
%adhered as closely as possible to the official LAHSA 2020 PIT data collection and analysis protocols. 
%
%The \Count\ was launched from The Center at Blessed Sacrament (``The Center''), a major service 
%provider in Hollywood, at 6636 Selma Ave. All volunteer teams reported and returned to this 
%location as they would to a LAHSA community hub in past years, but, as COVID precautions, 
%training was performed remotely in the week preceding the count and volunteers never left their 
%vehicles.

\subsection{Data Acquisition}
\label{sec:acquisition}

The \Count\ covered the \ntracts\ US Census tracts constituting the LAHSA-defined Hollywood 
and East Hollywood Communities (21 and 18 tracts, \resp). It was based out of The Center at Blessed 
Sacrament (``The Center''), a major service provider in Hollywood. All volunteers reported and returned 
to this location as they would to a LAHSA community hub in past years

Our \Count\ differed from previous PIT counts in that (1) training was performed remotely in the week 
preceding the count; (2) volunteers never left their vehicles; and (3) it did not recognize census 
tract ``splits''---e.g., ``1905.10a''---making our results slightly more coarsely resolved. 
The latter choice also slightly modified of the definition of Hollywood---which included all of tract 
1905.10 instead of the ``a'' split---and East Hollywood---which included all of 1913.01 instead of 
the ``b'' split. Such modifications have an insignificant impact on community-level results: since 2016, 
tract 1905.10b has never hosted more than 7 unsheltered people, 1913.01a never more than 15 people. 
%Sections \ref{sec:results} and \ref{sec:discussion} discuss community-level results with 
%tract-level tallies provided in the Appendix. Results for Greater Hollywood are not directly comparable 
%to any official service geography but are available upon request. 
Figure \ref{fig:map} shows the \Count\ footprint.

All tracts were vetted by professionals from The Center prior to assignment. Tracts deemed 
especially challenging---e.g., due to their proximity to freeway onramps/peripheries---were 
reserved for professional counting teams. Vetting produced \nprof\ such tracts, which were surveyed 
by outreach personnel from The Center and Covenant House circa 3:00 PM on 25 February. The 
remaining \nvol\ tracts were divided among the volunteer vehicle-based teams and surveyed 
beginning at 7.00 PM. With the exception of one tract in East Hollywood, teams were restricted 
to one or the other community, making the community-level results nearly independent. 
Cross-comparisons therefore serve as data quality indicators (Section \ref{sec:discussion}). 
Table \ref{tbl:tractStats} records which tract was counted by which kind of team. 

Thirty-two volunteer teams participated in the \Count, which was limited to existing ``pods'' of two 
to three people to minimize the possibility of COVID transmission. Singlet volunteers were admitted 
but remained on-site to assist with traffic control and material distribution. All participants wore 
personal protective equipment and maintained social distancing when appropriate.

Counting followed 2020 LAHSA PIT protocols to the greatest extent possible. Each volunteer team 
was assigned two tracts and comprised at least a Driver and a Counter. Three-person teams 
included a Navigator, as well. If present, the Navigator directed the Driver while the Counter tallied 
unhoused individuals/dwellings. In two-person teams, the Counter doubled as the Navigator. Training 
emphasized techniques aimed at reducing Counters' cognitive loads to minimize counting errors, e.g., 
covering interior streets in a serpentine pattern before circling the tract border. Teams were instructed 
to count both sides of interior streets but only interior sides of border streets. They were also instructed 
to watch the official training video from the 2020 PIT count.

Upon arriving at The Center, organizers provided each team a clipboard containing:
\begin{itemize}
	\item two tract maps;
	\item two tally sheets;
	\item one 1-page training summary with a contact number for field issues.
\end{itemize}
The Appendix contains examples of the above documents.

The tally sheets---the data acquisition tool---contained separate columns for each of the nine 
categories of unhoused individuals/dwellings recognized in the 2020 LAHSA PIT count: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item adults (ages $\geq$25);
	\item transition age youths (``TAY,'' 18--24);
	\item unaccompanied minors;
	\item families (at least one adult with at least one minor); 
	\item cars;
	\item vans;
	\item RVs;
	\item tents;
	\item makeshift structures.
\end{enumerate}
The dwelling classes---Items 5--9---are treated differently than the individual classes in the analysis,
and are hereafter referred to by their acronym, ``CVRTM,'' when appropriate. 

All teams were deployed to their tracts by roughly 7:30 PM and returned by 9:55 PM.

Upon returning, organizers approached each team with a tablet computer or smartphone. Counters 
verbally read-off their results for each category as organizers entered them into a google 
form/spreadsheet. The organizer read back the results for confirmation before recovering all 
materials---including hand-written tallies---from the volunteers. Volunteer email addresses 
were also retained for follow-up. 

Once all materials were collected, the organizers convened to cross-check the electronic records
with the physical tally sheets and identify any uncounted areas. Any disagreement between electronic
and paper references was cross-checked and corrected to the paper tally.

Given the number of volunteers, every tract was counted by at least two volunteer teams, with four
tracts counted in triplicate. Such repeat measurements were designed to aid understanding of random 
counting errors (Sections \ref{sec:dupes}) but also served a data robustness purpose: one tally
could not be associated with a census tract and therefore had to be removed. 

All told, the data set comprises 37 pair-wise volunteer measurements---29 duplicates + 
4 triplicates (=8 additional pairs)---and 9 unique professional assessments.

\subsubsection{Volunteer Training}
\label{sec:training}

Teams underwent mandatory, $\sim$30 minute Zoom-based training sessions before arriving 
for the \Count. Each participant was also required to watch the official 2020 LAHSA count training 
video and sign participation waivers.

The training covered the motivation for the \Count, an overview of the survey geography, team roles, 
and examples of the classes of unhoused individuals/dwellings. Except in the case of people standing 
next to tents---as describes in the 2020 LAHSA video---volunteers were instructed to count 
CVRTM and individuals separately and not to try to estimate how many people might live in or be 
associated with a specific dwelling. This ensured that results could be analyzed as a function of the 
CVRTM weights, which may change with future information (see Section \ref{sec:analysis}).

Volunteers were primed only with min/max estimates of tract-level individual+dwelling counts 
(``0--120'') and the likelihood of encountering unaccompanied minors or families (``very unlikely'')
or TAY (``in some tracts in Hollywood''). These statements were informed by the 2020 LAHSA PIT 
results. No other prior count-based information was established to minimize biases. The training 
presentation is available at: \url{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xFrtU26yjPuiUv9KHZ3Uj2_sAoT1ClGo/view?usp=sharing}.

In sum, about 20\% of tracts in both communities were counted by professionals. The latter comprised
roughly 43\% of the total individuals and dwellings counted. Year-on-year trends are consistent between
volunteer- and professionally counted tracts. The largest increase was observed by volunteers, the largest
decrease by professionals; both tracts are located in E.~Hollywood.

\subsection{Data Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

The core component of the raw data was a $9\times73$ spreadsheet containing the
tract-level tallies for each unhoused individual/dwelling class. Repeat counts of the same
tract associated with the Hollywood or East Hollywood community, were averaged, and
unweighted where appropriate by the CVRTM mean occupancies. This process was repeated 
10,000 times randomly perturbing the counts and weights according to their respective 
uncertainties (see below). The result is a $9\times10000\times39$ array can then 
be split and summed to provide aggregate, tract, or category-level unsheltered
population estimates and uncertainties.

Our baseline result incorporates the 2020 SPA-4/CD13 estimates of the CVRTM weights provided
by LAHSA. These estimates underpin the latest LAHSA Community Summaries. We recognize 
that COVID-related activities may have changed these weights---e.g., via concerted tent distribution
efforts---since the last PIT count and analyze the impact of various CVRTM choices in 
Section \ref{sec:CVRTM}. However, reasonable modifications---including those based on updated
occupancy surveys---do not significantly affect our findings.

%While an estimate of the underlying population, uncertainties in each visual count and weight 
%must be accounted for to understand how confident one can be that that estimate corresponds to
%the truth. We accomplish this by using Monte Carlo integration to construct the full probability
%distribution functions (PDFs) for the number of unsheltered people of each class in each tract.

% {\it These results will
%correspond to the most likely values for the respective quantities in any geography.} However,
%three uncertainties---one small and two large---complicate the interpretation of those sums. 
%We discuss these in Section \ref{sec:discussion}, but account for them as best we can using 
%Monte Carlo techniques to construct the full underlying probability distribution functions (PDFs) 
%for each class in each tract.
%
%All results discussed below derive from 10,000 Monte Carlo realizations of Item (5), above.
%

\subsubsection{Monte Carlo Estimations of Unsheltered Probability Densities}
\label{sec:mc}

Our analysis accounts for two known sources of uncertainty: Poisson errors in the visual tallies and 
random deviations of the CVRTM weights from their quoted means. The former represents how a given 
tally might change if performed at a different (but comparable) time or by a different team. The latter 
represents how the mean occupancy of CVRTM structures in Hollywood might differ from the mean 
occupancy in the geography in which the weights were defined.

We model both uncertainties as Gaussian distributions with standard deviations of 
$\sqrt{n}$ and $\sigma$, \resp, where $n$ is the raw tally and $\sigma$ is the standard 
error on the respective mean CVRTM weight, $w$, quoted by LAHSA. As such, the $i$-th estimate 
of the true number, $N$, of people in the $j$-th unsheltered class in any tract is:
\begin{multline}\label{eq:monte}
	N_{i,j} = \left[n_{j} + \mathcal{G}_{i}(0,\sqrt{n_{j}})\right]\times\max[\mathcal{G}_{i}(w_{j}, \sigma_{j}),1],
\end{multline}
where $\mathcal{G}(\mu,\Sigma)$ is a Gaussian random number with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation 
$\Sigma$. If more than one team counted a given tract, $n$ is replaced by the average of their tallies 
and the attendant counting error is divided by the square root of the number of teams. If no members
of the $j$-th unsheltered category were observed, $\sqrt{n_{j}}$ is replaced in the first term above
by the estimated background rate, $\sigma_{j}^{\rm bkg}$, of that category (Section \ref{sec:nulls}).

The final output probability distribution functions (PDFs) are based on 10,000 realizations of 
Equation \ref{eq:monte}. For the Adult, and TAY, classes all weights are fixed to unity, such that 
$(w,\sigma)\equiv(1,0)$ for all trials and uncertainties reflect only counting errors. One potential 
family and one potential unaccompanied minor were reported, but not confirmed. We therefore
set those entires to zero, though still infer upper-limits.

We place a floor on the CVRTM mean occupancies at 1 person per dwelling; i.e., we assume that the average
person does not own more than one tent. This is not to say no one may own more than one tent, just that
such a statement is never representative. This choice induces a slight asymmetry in our global PDFs but
does not significantly affect inferences.
%letting the mean occupancies reach 0 moves the baseline result down by 40 ppl over all of grtr Hwood.
%it's 0.4 sigma or in the IQR.

\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Null Entries}
\label{sec:nulls}

Some tracts were observed to have unsheltered populations near zero, at least in specific person or 
dwelling categories. These tallies are consistent with a range of non-zero values for the true population 
due to shot noise. As such, the Monte Carlo PDF reconstruction allows them to take non-zero values 
based on an assumed background rate.

Ideally, that rate would be based on category variations in similar tracts defined by some independent 
criteria. Sufficient data from, e.g., the US Census may enable such an exercise, but it is beyond the scope of 
this analysis. Instead, we adopt a noise floor based on the counts expected if all elements of a given category
were evenly distributed across all tracts. Hence:
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_{j}^{\rm bkg} \equiv \sqrt{\frac{1}{39}\sum_{\rm tracts}n_{j}},
\end{equation}
where $n_{j}$ are the raw counts in that category as defined in Equation \ref{eq:monte}.

This method works for any category, $j$, for which there is at least one individual/dwelling observed in any 
tract. However, for categories for which this is not the case---unaccompanied minors and families, in the
case of Hollywood---we set $\sigma_{j, \rm min}$ to the lowest non-zero value of the other categories
(corresponding to TAY). The adopted backgrounds are: 
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_{j,\, \rm min}=\{3.2, 0.4, 0.4, 0.9, 1.3, 1.1, 2.8, 2.5, 0.4\}
\end{equation}
adults, TAY, unaccompanied minors, cars, vans, RVs, tents, makeshifts, and families per tract.

Such a treatment is somewhat arbitrary, but, since it is symmetric, and therefore unbiased, 
serves mainly to set the upper limits of intrinsically low-frequency categories (TAY, minors, families).

\subsection{Duplicate Counts}
\label{sec:dupes}

Each volunteer tract in both communities (30) were assigned to at least two independent counting teams.
Four tracts additionally received a third pass. Pass 1 was organized numerically by tract number.
Pass 2 paired high projected population tracts with a nearby tract. Pass 3 was the same as Pass 1 with 
tract pairings presented in reverse order (such that, if 2 teams were deployed simultaneously, they would
likely start in different tracts). 

Results for one of the two teams assigned to tract 1925.20 could not be interpreted, making it the only
volunteer tract with one population estimate.

Figure \ref{fig:dupeChar} shows the intercounter comparisons of raw counts (people+dwellings)
at the tract and category levels. Average offsets are close to Poisson expectations in all cases 
except for the highest occupancy tracts, where they are inflated by an outlier (see below).
Explicitly, $\langle\sqrt{(n_{1}-n_{2})^{2}/(n_{1} + n_{2})}\rangle=1.4$, where
$n$ are the total raw counts of dwellings and people in a given tract from one of the counting
teams. Given their salience, agreement in counting RVs is also significantly better than random 
errors would suggest.

The outlier is tract 1901.00, whose repeat measurements differ by $6.6\sigma$. There, 
one team counted $\{P,C,V,R,T,M\}=\{23,1,1,1,6,2\}$ while the other counted $\{77,15,10,1,6,6\}$. 
Abramson re-counted this tract on-foot 14 hours after the PIT tally, obtaining $\{36, 4, 6, 0, 8, 2\}$.
In total, this tally ($56\pm7$) is within 1.9$\sigma$ of the mean of the two volunteer teams ($75\pm6$). 
As such, we treat the PIT entries identically to the rest.  As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:dupeChar}, top,
the mean intercounter variance drops (to $1.3\,\sigma$) if this tract is excluded.

%1901.00 inter-counter difference is 4.7 sigma (sqrt(delta) / root(n1 + n2) / root(2))

%\begin{itemize}
%%	\item All vol tracts counted at least twice;
%%	\item 4 tracts counted 3x;
%%	\item One recount DQed for quality flag (1925.20);
%%	\item Dupe statistics look pretty good. Mean abs discrepancy is consistent
%%		with zero given standard error on mean except for TAY (2.7 sigma) and RVs (3.8).

%\end{itemize}

No team counted tracts in both Hollywood and East Hollywood, making the volunteer tract datasets
totally independent in those communities. Once the professional-counted tracts are included, cross-talk
comes only from one tract in East Hollywood counted by a team that surveyed five tracts in Hollywood. 
We discuss comparisons between volunteer and professionally counted tracts in both communities 
in Section \ref{sec:comp}.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

This section presents community level estimates for the number of unsheltered people living in
Hollywood and East Hollywood as of 25 February 2021. We start with summaries of each community 
in Sections \ref{sec:hWood} and \ref{sec:eHo} before discussing how those inferences compare to 
the official 2020 LAHSA data in Section \ref{sec:comp}. 

%Section \ref{sec:discussion} describes how 
%varying elements of Section \ref{sec:mc}'s analysis modulates these results.

\end{table*}


\subsection{Hollywood}
\label{sec:hWood}

Counters identified $702\pm44$ (95\% CI) persons and dwellings in the 21 census tracts 
comprising the Hollywood community. The 5 tracts counted by professional teams---largely
along the US 101 corridor---comprised 42\% of those counts. Tract 1910.00 (pro-counted)
had the highest number of people and dwellings (123); 1899.03 had the least (0). These
tracts also bracket the total population statistics. The plurality
of counts were of persons on the street, followed by tents and makeshift structures 
(Figure \ref{fig:rawCounts}, left).

Modulated by the baseline CVRTM weights, the above estimates imply a total unsheltered
population in Hollywood of $936\pm92$ people (90\% CI; Figure \ref{fig:communityPDFs},
left), with the plurality (35\%) living in tents (Table \ref{tbl:summary}).

Modifying the CVRTM weights from the baseline SPA4/CD13 values to the SPA4 wide values 
lowers Hollywood's inferred total unsheltered population to $912\pm68$ people; applying
an updated tent weight based on a survey in Hollywood raises it to $944\pm118$ people.
Neither represents a significant change from the baseline estimate.

\subsection{East Hollywood}
\label{sec:eHo}

Counters identified $389\pm33$ (95\% CI) persons and dwellings in the 18 census tracts 
comprising East Hollywood. The 4 tracts counted by professional teams comprised 46\% of 
those counts. Tract 1927.00 (pro-counted) had the highest number of people and dwellings (87); 
1912.04 had the least (5). These tracts also bracket the total population statistics. The plurality
of counts were of makeshift structures---statistically consistent with the number of 
persons identified on the street---followed by tents (Figure \ref{fig:rawCounts}, right).

Modulated by the baseline CVRTM weights, the above estimates imply a total unsheltered
population in East Hollywood of $556\pm83$ people (Figure \ref{fig:communityPDFs},
right), with the plurality (39\%) living in makeshift structures (Table \ref{tbl:summary}).

Modifying the CVRTM weights from the baseline SPA4/CD13 values to the SPA4 wide values 
lowers East Hollywood's inferred total unsheltered population to $539\pm59$ people; applying
an updated tent weight based on a survey in Hollywood raises it to $559\pm87$ people.
Neither represents a significant change from the baseline estimate.

\subsection{Comparison to 2020}
\label{sec:comp}

Figure \ref{fig:communityPDFs} shows the baseline total population inferences for the Hollywood
and East Hollywood communities. Overplotted as a red vertical line in each panel is the official LAHSA
estimate from the 2020 PIT count: 1058 unsheltered people in Hollywood, 656 in East Hollywood.
Our inference suggests a $>$95\% probability that the current population has fallen from those levels.
Specifically, we infer declines of $11\%\pm9\%$ and $15\%\pm12\%$, \resp, at 90\% confidence.

Underlying these statements is an assumption that the CVRTM weights have not changed since 2020.
We discuss this assumption in more detail in Section \ref{sec:discussion}, but Figure \ref{fig:wtComp}
illustrates the effect of three modifications, none of which alter our conclusion significantly. 
All estimates suggest at least a 93\% chance of a decline compared to the 2020 PIT count.

As highlighted in Figures \ref{fig:rawCounts} and \ref{fig:tractYrYr}, underlying this change in
inferred population is a significant reduction of raw {\it counts} of people and dwellings compared
to last year. Persons on the street, especially, have fallen by roughly 30\% in both communities. This
decline is enough to significantly reduce identified people and dwellings in 14 out of 39 census tracts 
whereas only 7 saw significant increases, leading to a net change of $-193\pm45$ counts. Indeed,
the only category to show a potential common gain in both communities is makeshift structures;
tents and RVs were flat, while cars and vans fell. {\bfr We return to that in Section \ref{sec:discussion}.}
The lack of change in tents is notable as it suggests that known tent distribution efforts by 
providers must in large part have gone to replacing damaged or destroyed structures, at least 
in Greater Hollywood.

However, examining smaller scales tells a somewhat different story than the inferred global decline 
in population, would suggest. Seven tracts saw at least a 50\% increase in their number of tents; five 
of which saw more than 100\% increases.\footnote{Tracts 1902.02, 1907.00, 1912.01, 1915.00, 1925.20,
which together account for nearly 10\% of all identified street dwellings and 17\%
of all counts.} 
In one case---tract 1907.00---the total population stayed flat
while the fraction of rough sleepers and tent-dwellers almost exactly swapped. Given this tract's location
in the commercial heart of Central Hollywood, this effect---combined with COVID-related relaxations of 
tent-folding ordinances and sanitation de-scoping---would actually suggest that the {\it visual salience}
of unsheltered living has increased in some key areas even as the population as a whole has declined.
(Unsheltered people make up 3.5\% of tract 1907.00's total population, according to 2020 estimates
from the US Census.) We discuss this phenomenon and cross-checks of our results in the next section.

\end{figure}

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

%Ancillary data from regularly monitored census tracts suggests that the date offset is unlikely to substantially 
%erode comparability between this and past datasets. Limited daytime recounts also suggest that 
%time-of-day effects are sub-dominant.

A $\sim$30\% drop in unsheltered individuals in both Hollywood and 
East Hollywood drives the decline we find, for which government initiatives to move people indoors 
(Project Roomkey) and staunch inflow into homelessness (eviction moratoria) may be responsible. 
Indeed, \href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4672-2020-homeless-count-council-district-13}{CD13's} share of \href{https://www.lahsa.org/documents?id=4585-2020-greater-los-angeles-homeless-count-los-angeles-continuum-of-care-coc-}{LA County's unsheltered senior population} (6.5\%) implies that perhaps 100 of its \href{https://projectroomkeytracker.com/}{1608 occupied rooms} were filled with Greater Hollywood residents on the night 
of the count---about half the inferred change. The opening of at least one 
\href{https://www.lamayor.org/ABridgeHome}{\it A Bridge Home} site in Los Feliz---whose catchment area 
includes Greater Hollywood---and 120 PATH permanent supportive housing units may also have contributed. 
The latter are located in tract 1927.00. While all of those units did not go to local residents, any that did would help
drive that tract's large observed decrease. Coordinated Entry System data will constrain these possibilities.
%1927.00 is actually in the catchment of 3 ABHs that were either new or expanded between PIT counts. 
%Lodi, however, did not fill its new beds, and Lafayette doesn't cover the whole tract, so we won't speculate.
%Nevertheless, technically, even at 50\% decompression, residents of 1927.00 may have been eligible 
%for any of 89 new ABH beds. It's also on the CoC boundary.

{\it However}, to say nothing of the implications of the above for conditions after the eviction moratoria
lapse, if there are fewer people on the street today, their quality of life has degraded markedly. COVID has restricted or 
eliminated access to restaurant and park bathrooms, libraries (and so 
\href{https://www.lapl.org/homeless-resources/the-source}{\it The Source} service days), DPSS 
(EBT, Medi-Cal), DMV (ID replacement), and DMH facilities. Physical limitations on caseworker 
access to clients at hospitals and clinics has also hindered successful discharges. These qualitative harms are reflected 
by a 25\% increase in 
\href{https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-07/the-powerful-synthetic-opioid-fentanyl-is-behind-rising-deaths-in-the-homeless-population}{overdose deaths}, and visually amplified by a doubling of unsheltered dwellings in 13\% of census 
tracts\footnote{Including 1907.00, Central Hollywood's commercial core.} as enforcement of tent folding ordinances
(LAMC 56.11) and City and State sanitation programs were simultaneously 
\href{https://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2020/20-0147_misc_3-17-20_p.pdf}{suspended or de-scoped}. 
So, while the PIT data may support the efficacy of programs designed to reduce street 
homelessness, they do {\it not} suggest that the state of homelessness in Greater Hollywood has improved. In the 
fight to rebuild lives---as well as build homes---that fact must remain paramount.

\subsubsection{Cross-checks}
\label{sec:crossChecks}

The Hollywood Partnership---one of Hollywood's Business Improvement Districts (BIDs)---has performed
weekly visual scans of its footprint since spring 2019. These inspections tally unsheltered people and 
tents separately. As such, they can be used to bound the possible evolution of the CVRTM tent weight
between the official 2020 value and what it may be today.

Multiple cross-checks suggest that the raw counts from our 2021 PIT enumeration are accurate:
\begin{enumerate}
%	\setlength{\itemsep}{-1ex}
	\item Comparisons of the count's 37 duplicate tract measurements suggest per-tract and per-category
		counting uncertainties are consistent with the random errors built into the analysis.
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item Tract 1901.00---the only outlier in the above comparisons---was independently recounted 
%				14 hours after the PIT count with results consistent with the average of the volunteer teams' 
%				results.
%			\item Tract 1912.01---largest increase---was independently recounted on 27 Feb.\ circa 
%				12:00 PM with results similarly consistent with the PIT teams' assessments.
%			\item Tract 1927.00---largest decrease---was independently recounted on 4 March at 
%				8:30 AM with results lower than the PIT's assessment. This especially dense tract was originally 
%				surveyed on foot by outreach professionals, however, with the recount was performed by a car-based
%				volunteer. The cross-check therefore suggests only that the PIT data are not biased in ways that
%				would induce an artificial year-on-dear decline.				
%		\end{itemize}
	\item External data from \href{https://hollywoodpartnership.com/}{\it The Hollywood Partnership}

% 1907.00 is also interesting in that total population stayed nearly the same but identified
% individuals and dwellings basically swapped: IND 73->38; CVRTM 31->70. This has a big impact
% on people's perceptions, and it's in a very high-traffic part of the community.

%The pro/vol trends are consistent everywhere except tract 1927.00, 
%			where pro counts dropped significantly more for both individuals and dwellings (esp.\ 
%			tents). 1927.00 comprises 22\% of total counts in East Hollywood. Unsheltered 
%			homelessness in that CoC was flat or rose slightly outside of that tract.}
%{\bfr 1927.00 is the tract with the PATH Madison PSH. Phase II opened in Jan 2020---leasing began May 
%2020---and is 120 units, some of which were filled from nearby folks but I dunno how many. LEA recounted 
%this tract 4 March at $\sim$9:00 AM and found 94 total population vs.\ pro's 129. Only place where
%LEA counted more objects was vans. Adding that to the pro total adds 16 people (9 vans).


\subsubsection{CVRTM Effects}
\label{sec:CVRTM}


 % (Figure \ref{fig:wtComp})

Nevertheless, the CVRTM weights are systematic uncertainties: if the average tent or makeshift structure holds
more people today compared to last year, then the inferred population decrease may be artificial. Given the drop in 
unweighted counts, however, those dwellings' {\it average} occupancies must have risen to 2.2 and 2.6 people 
from 1.5 and 1.7 people, \resp, to erase the decline. Such $\sim$50\% increases in the mean seem unlikely given 
known COVID-related tent distribution efforts---which push in the opposite direction---and a 28 Feb.\ tent 
survey yielding a weight consistent with 2020's value. 

The $T$ and $M$ weights are the largest 
potential error sources in this analysis due to the high proportion of people living in tents and makeshift structures. 
While the full 2021 PIT area has not been assessed, SELAH outreach teams surveyed 47 tents (38 responses) in 
Hollywood on 28 Feb., yielding a mean occupancy of $T=1.39\pm0.14$ people per tent ($T=1.50\pm0.22$ when 
non-responses are modeled). Although $M$ was not estimated, that $T$ value is consistent with the official 2020 
weight of $T=1.48\pm0.11$. We encourage more robust efforts to update the CVRTM weights.
%the occupancy increases needed to erase our estimated changes are
%substantial. 

{\bfr Up to the number of vehicle dwellers in safe parking locations,} the above suggests that our results 
are both quantitatively and qualitatively reliable.\\
